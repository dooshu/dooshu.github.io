“Are you OK?”


David Gelles, a business reporter at the New York Times, was one of many reporters pursuing the story of Musk’s 2018 dramas. “He has to talk to us,” he told a person who worked with Musk. Late on the afternoon of Thursday, August 16, Gelles got a call. “What do you want to know?” Musk asked him.

“Were you on drugs when you sent that tweet?”

“No,” Musk answered. He did say he had used the prescription sleep medicine Ambien. Some of his board worried that he was overusing it.

Gelles could tell Musk was exhausted. Instead of peppering him with tough questions, he decided to try to draw him out. “Elon, how are you doing?” he asked. “Are you OK?”

The conversation went on for an hour.

“It’s not been great, actually,” Musk said. “I’ve had friends come by who are really concerned.” Then he paused for a long time, overcome by emotion. “There were times when I didn’t leave the factory for three or four days—days when I didn’t go outside,” he said. “This has really come at the expense of seeing my kids.”

The Times had been told that Musk had worked with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, who would later be convicted of child sex-trafficking charges. Musk denied it. Indeed, he had no connections with Epstein, other than the fact that Epstein’s enabler Ghislaine Maxwell, whom Musk didn’t know, had once photo-bombed him by standing behind him at the Met Gala.

Gelles asked whether things were improving. Yes, for Tesla, Musk said. “But from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.” He began to choke up. There were long pauses as he tried to regain his composure. As Gelles later noted, “In all the conversations I’ve had with business leaders over the years, not until Elon Musk got on the phone had an executive revealed such vulnerability.”

“Elon Musk Details ‘Excruciating’ Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil,” the headline read. The story reported how he had choked up during the interview. “Mr. Musk alternated between laughter and tears,” Gelles and his colleagues wrote. “He said he had been working up to 120 hours a week recently… [and] not taken more than a week off since 2001, when he was bedridden with malaria.” Other organizations picked up the story. “Erratic NYT Interview Raises Alarm about Tesla Chief’s Health,” was the headline on Bloomberg.

The next morning, Tesla stocked plunged 9 percent.





The Joe Rogan show


In the wake of the stories about his precarious psychological condition, Musk’s public relations consultant, Juleanna Glover, recommended that he clear up the issue by giving a long interview. “We just need to kill this nonsense speculation around your mental state,” she wrote. She said she would come up with “options that present you at length—leading the companies, in charge, droll and self-aware.” She added a warning: “In no universe is it OK for you to continue to contemplate the sexual predilections of a Thai diver who insulted you.”

The venue Musk chose to quash the speculations that he had gone loopy was the video-streamed podcast of Joe Rogan, a knowledgeable and sharp-witted pundit, comedian, and (a bit too appropriately) Ultimate Fighting Championship color commentator, who likes to meander through minefields with his guests, flouting political correctness and courting controversy. Rogan lets his guests ramble on, and Musk did, for more than two and a half hours. He described how to create a snakelike exoskeleton when building tunnels. He ruminated about the threat of artificial intelligence, whether robots would take revenge on us, and how Neuralink could create a direct high-bandwidth connection between our minds and our machines. And they discussed how humans might be unwitting avatars in a video-game simulation devised by a higher intelligence.

These ruminations may not have seemed the perfect way for Musk to convince institutional investors that he had a firm grip on base reality, but the interview at least seemed like it would do no harm. But then, Rogan lit up a big “marijuana inside of tobacco” joint and offered Musk a toke.

“You probably can’t because of stockholders, right?” Rogan said, giving Musk an out.

“I mean, it’s legal right?” Musk replied. They were in California.

“Totally legal,” said Rogan, handing over the spliff. Musk took a tentative puff, mischievously.

A few moments later, when they were talking about the role of geniuses in furthering civilization, Musk turned to look at his phone. “You getting text messages from chicks?” asked Rogan.

Musk shook his head. “I’m getting text messages from friends saying, ‘What the hell are you doing smoking weed?’ ”

The front page of the next day’s Wall Street Journal looked like no other the paper had ever run. It had a very big picture of Musk, with glassy eyes and a crooked smirk, holding the fat joint in his left hand with a cloud of smoke wafting around his head. “Tesla Inc.’s share price sank to near its lowest point for the year Friday after the electric-car maker lost more executives and Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to smoke marijuana during an interview streamed on the web,” reporter Tim Higgins wrote.

Musk may not have broken state law, but in addition to further rattling investors, he appeared to have broken federal regulations, leading to an investigation by NASA. “SpaceX was a NASA contractor, and they are big believers in the law,” Musk says. “So I had to be subjected to random drug tests for a couple of years. Fortunately, I really don’t like doing illegal drugs.”





Flamethrower


Musk had come to the Joe Rogan studio bearing a gift for his podcast host: a plastic flamethrower with The Boring Company logo on it. Together they played with the toy, gleefully shooting its short propane flame as Sam Teller and the studio staff dodged and laughed.

The flamethrower was a good metaphor for Musk himself. He took glee in blurting out eyebrow-singeing comments. The idea came after the company merchandised “Boring Company” hats and sold out fifteen thousand of them. “What’s next?” Musk asked. Someone suggested a toy flamethrower. “Oh my God, let’s do it,” Musk responded. He was a fan of the movie Spaceballs, a Mel Brooks parody of Star Wars that has a scene in which a Yoda-like character touts the movie’s merchandise for sale, culminating with the line “Take home the flamethrower.” Musk’s kids loved that line.

Steve Davis, who ran The Boring Company, found a relatively safe prototype that could melt snow and singe weeds but was technically not hot enough to be regulated as a flamethrower. They began marketing it, tongue in cheek, as “not a flamethrower” to avoid running afoul of the law. The terms and conditions declared:

I will not use this in a house

I will not point this at my spouse

I will not use this in an unsafe way

The best use is creme brulee…

… and that exhausts our rhyming ability.



They priced it at $500 (it now goes for twice that on eBay) and within four days had sold out twenty thousand of them, grossing $10 million.

Musk’s goofy mode is the flip side of his demon mode. When he is in the darkest of places, he often cycles between anger and cackling laughter.

His humor has many levels. The lowest is his puerile affection for poop emojis, fart sounds programmed into the Tesla, and other discharges of bathroom humor. Say the voice command “Open Butthole” to the console in a Tesla, and it opens the electric charging port at the rear of the vehicle.

He also has a mordant, ironic strand of humor, demonstrated by a poster on the wall of his cubicle at SpaceX. It shows a twinkling dark blue sky with a shooting star. “When you wish upon a falling star, your dreams can come true,” it reads. “Unless it’s really a meteor hurtling to the Earth which will destroy all life. Then you’re pretty much hosed, no matter what you wish for. Unless it’s death by meteorite.”

The most deeply ingrained strand of his humor is a metaphysical science-geek droll cleverness that he absorbed when he read and reread Douglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. In the midst of his turmoil in 2018, he decided to launch his old cherry-red Tesla Roadster into deep space on an orbit that would, after four years, take it near Mars. He did it on the first launch of his new Falcon Heavy, a twenty-seven-engine rocket made by strapping together three Falcon 9 boosters. The Tesla had a copy of The Hitchhiker’s Guide in the glove compartment and a sign on the dashboard with the “DON’T PANIC!” injunction from the novel.





Kimbal rupture


During their rough childhoods and as partners in Zip2, Kimbal and Elon had often fought ferociously with each other. But through it all, Kimbal had been Elon’s closest compatriot, the one who understood him and would stick by him, even while telling him uncomfortable truths.

After Antonio Gracias summoned him back from his honeymoon in July, Kimbal worked almost full-time at Tesla, ignoring the farm-to-table restaurant business he had started in Colorado. During the SEC crisis, he was one of the strongest voices urging Elon to settle. And when Elon became fearful that some of his board might be plotting against him, Kimbal flew down to Los Angeles to stay with him. During one tense Saturday meeting at Elon’s house, Kimbal did what he had done after the Falcon launch failure in Kwaj and many other times, which was to relieve the tension by cooking. This time he made salmon with peas and a potato-onion casserole.

But Kimbal’s frustration with his brother had been building, especially when it took outsiders to convince him to settle with the SEC. A breaking point came in October. His restaurant group was having financing problems, and he needed to raise more money. “So I called Elon and I said, ‘Look, I need you to help fund my business.’ ” The round was going to be about $40 million, and Kimbal needed Elon to do $10 million as a loan. Elon initially agreed. “I remember,” says Kimbal, “writing down in my journal, ‘unconditional love for Elon.’ ” But when Kimbal reached out to get the money transferred, Elon had changed his mind. His personal financial manager, Jared Birchall, had gone over the numbers and advised Elon that Kimbal’s business was not sustainable. “The money Elon was putting into it was getting poured down the drain,” Birchall told me. So Elon gave Kimbal the bad news: “I had my finance guy look at it, and the restaurants are struggling. I think they should die.”

“What did you just say?” Kimbal yelled. “Fuck you. Fuck you! This is not how it works.” He reminded Elon, forcefully, that when Tesla’s finances were struggling, he had come to work by his brother’s side and provided him financing. “If you would’ve looked at Tesla finance, it should have died as well,” Kimbal said. “So this is not how this works.”

Elon eventually relented. “I basically strong-armed him into putting in five million,” says Kimbal. The restaurants survived. But the incident nevertheless caused a rupture. “I was absolutely furious with Elon and didn’t speak to him,” he says. “I felt like I lost my brother. That experience at Tesla had taken him to a place where he lost his mind. At that point I was like, ‘I’m done with you.’ ”

After six weeks of silence, Kimbal reached out to heal the rift. “I decided to go back to being Elon’s brother because I didn’t want to lose him,” he says. “I missed my brother.” I asked how Elon reacted when he reached out to him. “He responded as if nothing had happened,” Kimbal said. “That’s how Elon is.”





JB Straubel exits


Not surprisingly, many of Musk’s top executives fled during the 2018 production hell and accompanying turmoil. Jon McNeill, who was Tesla’s president overseeing sales and marketing, had taken on the role of helping Musk through his bouts of mental anguish, including when he was lying on the conference room floor. “It was becoming absolutely exhausting for me,” he says. He went to Musk in January 2018, urged him to get psychological help, and said, “I love you, but I can’t do this anymore.”

Doug Field, the senior vice president of engineering, was considered a possible future CEO of Tesla. But Musk lost confidence in him at the outset of the production hell surge and stripped him of his role overseeing manufacturing. He left to go to Apple and then Ford.

The most important departure, at least symbolically and emotionally, was that of JB Straubel, the cheery cofounder who had stuck by Musk for sixteen years, ever since their 2003 dinner where Straubel had extolled the possibility of using lithium-ion batteries to make electric cars. At the end of 2018, he took a long vacation, his first real one in fifteen years. “My percent happiness level was low and trending downward,” he says. He was getting much more pleasure from a side venture he had founded, Redwood Materials, which aimed to recycle lithium-ion car batteries. Another factor was Musk’s mind-space at the time. “He was struggling, and that made him more mercurial than even the normal,” Straubel says. “I felt terrible for him and tried to help him as a friend, but couldn’t really.”

Musk is usually not sentimental about people leaving. He likes fresh blood. He is more concerned with a phenomenon he calls “phoning in rich,” meaning people who have worked at the company for a long time and, because they have enough money and vacation homes, no longer hunger to stay all night on the factory floor. But in the case of Straubel, Musk felt a personal affection as well as professional trust. “I was a little surprised at Elon’s reluctance to have me leave,” says Straubel.

Throughout early 2019, they had several conversations, and Straubel experienced Musk’s erratic emotional oscillations. “He can flip, usually without warning, between being quite emotional and human to being literally zero percent of that,” Straubel says. “Sometimes he can feel extremely loving and caring, shockingly so, and you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, yeah, we’ve been through incredible hardship together and have this deep bond and I love you, man.’ But then it becomes mixed with that blank stare, where it feels like he’s seeing straight through you and not registering any emotion at all.”

The plan they came up with was to announce Straubel’s departure at Tesla’s June 2019 annual meeting, to be held at the Computer History Museum near Palo Alto. Given the venue, it would be a chance to walk through the history of Tesla, from a dream sixteen years earlier to the now-profitable pathfinder into the era of electric vehicles. They would then introduce Straubel’s successor Drew Baglino, a twelve-year company veteran. Straubel and Baglino had the same lanky aw-shucks body language and manner, and their affection ran deep.

In the greenroom just before the event, Musk had second thoughts about announcing Straubel’s departure. “I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” he said. “I don’t think we should do it today.” Straubel was secretly relieved. Facing his departure was emotionally hard.

Musk did the first part of the presentation alone. “It’s been a hell of a year,” he began, a phrase that was true on many levels. The Model 3 was now outselling all competitors combined—gasoline or electric—in the luxury car category, and it was the highest-selling by revenue of any car in the U.S. “Ten years ago, nobody would’ve believed that could happen,” he said. His giddy humor flashed on for a moment. He began giggling about the “fart app” that allowed Tesla drivers to hit a button so the passenger seat would emit a fart sound when someone sat on it. “It’s like perhaps my finest piece of work,” he said.

He also, as always, promised that self-driving Teslas were just around the corner. “We expect to be feature complete with autonomy by the end of this year,” he said, adding 2019 to the years this had been promised. “It should be able to go from your home garage to your parking space at work without intervention.” An audience member went to the microphone and challenged him, saying that his previous promises about self-driving had not come true. Musk laughed, knowing the questioner was right. “Yeah, I’m sometimes a little too optimistic about time frames,” he said. “It’s time you knew that, yeah. But would I be doing this if I wasn’t optimistic? Geez.” The audience applauded. They were down with the joke.

When he invited Straubel and Baglino to the stage, there were loud cheers. Among Tesla fans, they were beloved stars. Straubel said with genuine affection, “Drew joined my team when it was a tiny, tiny team of five or ten of us a couple years after the company got started, and he’s been my right-hand person involved in almost every key initiative that I’ve done at the company.” This was the point when Straubel had planned to announce his retirement. Instead, Straubel and Musk took the opportunity to reminisce. “I trace Tesla back to 2003, with JB and me having lunch with Harold Rosen,” Musk said. “Yeah, that was a good conversation.”

“We didn’t exactly envision how this would unfold,” Straubel added.

“I believed we for sure would fail,” said Musk. “Back in 2003, people thought electric cars were the stupidest thing ever, bad in every way, something like a golf cart.”

“But it needed to be done,” Straubel said.

During an earnings call a few weeks later, Musk casually dropped the news that Straubel was departing. But Musk’s respect for him endured. In 2023, he would invite Straubel to join the board of Tesla.
