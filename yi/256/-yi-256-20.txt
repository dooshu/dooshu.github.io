爱与非爱的各种类型


在任何时候，人们都会渴望金钱、知识或者爱；有时一个人可以同时渴望其中的两样，但永远不可能同时渴望这三样。

没有牺牲的爱就像是偷窃。

婚姻是让男人女性化——同时也让女人女性化——的标准过程。

有些男人让自己被女人（以及财富）包围，是为了炫耀；另一些男人这样做主要是为了消费，这两类人基本不重合。

除开友谊和爱之外，你很难找到参与双方都是愚人的情况。

我参加过的一次座谈会借用了公元前4世纪雅典一场酒会的名字（在那场酒会上，并非书呆子的雅典人谈论爱的话题），结果，座谈会上没有酒喝，并且幸好也没人谈论爱的话题。

最关注你的人是那些恨你的人。朋友、追求者和伴侣都不可能对你如此好奇。

当年轻女人跟其他方面毫无吸引人之处的富有男人恋爱时，她可以真诚地相信，她是被他的某个特殊身体部位（例如鼻子、脖子、膝盖）迷住了。

一个好的敌人，比最有价值的追求者更加忠诚，更加容易预料，并且对聪明人来说也更加有用。

如果诽谤我的人们更了解我的话，他们就会更恨我。





ON THE VARIETIES OF LOVE AND NONLOVE


At any stage, humans can thirst for money, knowledge, or love; sometimes for two, never for three.



Love without sacrifice is like theft.

Marriage is the institutional process of feminizing men——and feminizing women.

There are men who surround themselves with women (and seek wealth) for ostentation; others who do so mostly for consumption; they are rarely the same.

Outside of friendship and love, it is very hard to find situations with bilateral, two-way suckers.

I attended a symposium, an event named after a 4th Century (B. C.) Athenian drinking party in which nonnerds talked about love; alas, there was no drinking and, mercifully, nobody talked about love.

You will get the most attention from those who hate you. No friend, no admirer, and no partner will flatter you with as much curiosity.

When a young woman partners with an otherwise uninteresting rich man, she can sincerely believe that she is attracted to some very specific body part (say, his nose, neck, or knee).

A good foe is far more loyal, far more predictable, and, to the clever, far more useful than the most valuable admirer.

If my detractors knew me better they would hate me even more.
