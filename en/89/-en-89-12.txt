Chapter 1

1 See Howard E. Gruber, Darwin on Man：A Psychological Study of Scientific Creativity, together with Darwin’s Early and Unpublished Notebooks, transcribed and annotated by Paul H. Barrett (New York：E. P. Dutton & Co., Inc., 1974), pp. 13, 57, 302, 305, 321, 360, 380. In 1838 Darwin read Smith’s Essays on Philosophical Subjects, to which was prefixed Dugald Stewart’s An Account of the Life and Writings of the Author (London：Cadell and Davies, 1795, pp. xxvi–xxvii). Of the latter, Darwin noted that he had read it and that it was ‘worth reading as giving abstract of Smith’s views’. In 1839 Darwin read Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments; or, An Essay Towards an Analysis of the Principles by which Men Naturally judge concerning the Conduct and Character, first of their Neighbours, and afterwards of themselves, to which is added, A Dissertation on the Origin of Languages, 10th ed., 2 vols. (London：Cadell & Davies, 1804). There does not appear to be any evidence that Darwin read The Wealth of Nations. – Ed.
