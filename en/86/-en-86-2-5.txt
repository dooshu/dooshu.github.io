5 Culture Fit

Customers will never love a company until the employees love it first.

— Simon Sinek

IN OUR OWN WORKING CAREERS and in our interviews we heard story after story of perfect jobs eroding into painful and frustrating relationships between employees and employers. Skills, experience, and interest feel perfectly aligned at first, then something else interferes with a job’s capacity to bring out our best. Of the six critical elements of work fit, culture fit is often the hardest to grasp. It’s largely invisible, unwritten, and unspoken, but, paradoxically, it causes employees the greatest pain, dissatisfaction, frustration, and failure to thrive.

While culture fit may be hard to grasp, when you get it right it’s exhilarating for the employee and employer. Allie experienced poor culture fit at one organization because the processes were inconsistent and she felt unseen and undervalued. After moving on she found her sweet spot and experienced the joy that comes when the job fits right. She said, “I currently have a fabulous job. It’s not the financial benefits – I’ve never made such a small salary. I help people; I’m valued. Relationships with service receivers and coworkers are valued and developed. There’s zero micro-management (I feel tremendous trust for and from my boss and coworkers). I’m allowed creative freedom. I’m free to be my own person. Mistake isn’t a word we use, only growth opportunities – and this is genuine. The culture comes from the boss, who truly doesn’t sweat the small stuff and models calm and capable responses even in crisis.”

In Allie’s story we can see that how her new company does things aligns well with how she likes to work: she has freedom, mistakes are seen as opportunities, and the environment is stable. For Allie, these are the keys to culture fit. Two organizations in the same business may be very different in the environment they offer, and whether that environment works for a particular person depends on that person’s preferences and needs. We can get a glimpse at the diverse views of what constitutes a good culture by looking at the ways CEOs describe their cultures:

Culture is simply a shared way of doing something with passion.

— Brian Chesky, Co-Founder, CEO, Airbnb

We try to have the kind of a culture that doesn’t value excuses in the sense that when you’re supposed to accomplish something, and you’re at a high level, then your job is to accomplish it, in spite of difficulty. And you’re rewarded for dealing with that.

— Phil Libin, Co-Founder, former CEO, Evernote

We have a culture where we are incredibly self-critical; we don’t get comfortable with our success.

— Mark Parker, CEO, Nike

There’s no magic formula for great company culture. The key is just to treat your staff how you would like to be treated.

— Richard Branson, Founder, Virgin Group

CEO’s views are as diverse as a culture’s effect on each employee. For Jasper, being treated by his boss the way his boss wants to be treated (as Richard Branson mentions) might appeal to his sense of fairness and equity, whereas Jane might be drawn to an accomplishment culture such as Nike’s.

What is Culture?

Culture is often defined simply as “the way we do things here,” and it profoundly impacts how we thrive at work. Jean described it this way: “I couldn’t put my finger around why the culture didn’t work well for me at my first job. On the surface, it seemed ideal. But over time, it became clear that the way people acted with each other reflected beliefs and values that were inconsistent with what mattered to me. It came to a head when I noticed a pattern of senior leaders regularly presenting new ideas from their teams as their own. It just didn’t sit well with me because it felt that the people doing the work were invisible.”

People around the world have become very curious about culture and its role in organizations. With unemployment rates continuing to decrease to a low of 4.9 percent in October 2016 (compared to a high of 10 percent in October 2009) employees are increasingly in charge of determining where to work (U.S. Department of Labor 2016). Culture will remain a critical dimension in their choices and in their contentment with their choices.

Let’s take a short moment to explain what we mean by culture, how it’s measured, and its impact on work fit. By most measures, organizational culture matters to companies and employees for two key reasons:

• It determines the organization’s ability to sustain its health over time via performance and results.

• It reflects an employee’s daily behaviors, which determine ease of fit and probability of a long-term partnership.

Theories about culture gained popularity in business and management journals in the mid-1900s as organizational development (OD) grew as a field of research and practice dedicated to expanding the effectiveness of people within organizations.

Researchers suggested that organizational culture could significantly affect organizational outcomes, reasoning that culture could be used to affect employee actions, distinguish firms from one another, and create competitive advantage. Organizational cultures start with the values and actions of the company’s founders and develop over time as the organization grows and responds to challenges.

Much press has been given in the past 20 years to company perks such as on-site day care, coffee lounges, dry cleaning services, and nap rooms, which we can think of as artifacts, or visible evidence, of culture. In our experience, these perks are far less important to employees than intangible rewards. Virgin Pulse’s (2015) recent study showed that 77 percent of Millennial workers felt that culture was more important than salary and benefits. As Ray Hennessy (2016) said in Entrepreneur when he wrote about a company that offered to pay wedding costs as a benefit, “A company with a ping-pong table, ice cream socials, and all-expenses-paid Grub-Hub accounts can have lousy culture. Good company culture goes well beyond perks.”

Over the last 65 years, as OD theory and practice have evolved, corporate culture has come into focus and is typically defined as the assumptions, values, and behaviors that contribute to the unique environment of a company. Often considered the father of organizational culture theory, Edward Schein maintained that culture was the hardest part of a company to change, outlasting products, services, founders, and all physical attributes.

Company values and beliefs are sometimes expressed formally in writing, but whether implicit or explicit, values become evident to employees during the course of work itself.

Cameron recalls a time when he realized that honesty was of primary importance at his new job. His boss, after the team missed a deadline, immediately called the client to inform them of the project schedule change and owned the problem fully. In other jobs, Cameron saw managers fudge to customers about deadlines and deflect accountability. He appreciated his leader staying true to the value of honesty. When your values are aligned with your company’s values, it feels like you have a good culture fit.

Just below the values of a company lies the deepest level of organizational culture, the tacit assumptions held between the people who work there, often unseen and not consciously identified in interactions, but very much at play (Shein 1990, 112). These are what are sometimes called the unwritten rules of a company, and they explain why there can be paradoxical behaviors within an organization. For example, at a manufacturing company, despite its professed value that “People are the lifeblood of our company,” senior leaders’ decisions and actions reflected a higher value being placed on expense reduction than on people. When reward and recognition systems were designed and implemented, the company chose lower cost over employee retention, causing high turnover and low engagement.

It’s that gap between professed values and tacit assumptions that often makes orientation and assimilation into a company a slow and arduous process for new employees.

Patsy says her situation felt ideal at first. After trying for several years to get hired by a public foundation doing great work, she was thrilled to get a program coordinator job and was relocated to a new city. At first, the culture fit felt great. The foundation’s mission was a key driver for all activities, and people were energized and bought into solving big social problems together.

But after the first month, Patsy began to feel some rumblings of trouble. The organization was in a fast-growth mode and often scrambling for funding. This created high adaptability and flexibility, which Patsy appreciated. But she also needed clear and repeated processes. Part of Patsy’s work style was to create order, organize, follow rules, and get similar results over and over again. As she learned the job, she realized that the organization was unpredictable and dynamically changing its basic processes. Over time, this created anxiety for Patsy, and after trying to make it work for more than a year, she realized that she needed a job with more structure and clarity so that she could really thrive.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• What values do I cherish?

• How do my values affect my work?



Attributes of Culture Fit

When we examine cultural fit, it’s important to differentiate between “a healthy culture” and “the right culture for me.” But there are some characteristics that are seen consistently in organizations with generally healthy cultures, regardless of one’s personal needs.

There are four attributes of culturally healthy organizations:

• Culture is discussed and examined at the very top.

• The organization has a viewpoint on moral and ethical behavior.

• Internal and external messages are consistent.

• The company embraces transparency.

In unhealthy cultures, these dimensions aren’t present, or they’re inconsistently applied, which creates stress, anxiety, and frustration for employees.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Does my current workplace possess these four attributes?

• If one or more are lacking, how important is that to me? Why or why not?



Once you know that these four attributes are in place, you can take a more in-depth look at the culture to determine how it aligns with your own personal values. (We’ll discuss this in more detail in Chapter 12, “Knowing Yourself and What You Want.”) For example, a company in a start-up mode is often focused on flexibility and customer responsiveness, whereas a manufacturer of consumer goods may emphasize extreme efficiency and consistency to drive lower costs. Most models and measurement tools that examine culture consider two primary dimensions: the way the organization responds to its external and internal environments, and the stability/flexibility it possesses. Figure 5-1 shows how Dan Denison and team depict this interplay of the two dimensions in examining culture. In addition to the two dimensions, their model features four organizational traits: Adaptability, Mission, Involvement, and Consistency. The bullet points below describe the characteristics of those traits.

Adaptability (external focus/flexible)

• The organization is able to learn.

• The organization is able to know and respond quickly to competitive innovations and customer expectations, as well as price.

• The organization invests in learning, training, and employee knowledge.

• Creativity and new ways to work are explored.

• Things are easy to change.

• Risk taking is rewarded.

Mission (external focus/stable)

• Values are commonly understood.

• Clarity of “where we are going” and higher purpose exists for each and every role in the company.

• The organization has a long-term purpose and direction.

• There’s agreement about goals throughout the organization.

• People know what must be done to succeed.

Involvement (internal focus/flexible)

• There’s acceptance and appreciation for diversity.

• The organization displays a regard for and fair treatment of each employee as well as respect for each employee’s contribution to the company.

• Employees show pride, engagement, and enthusiasm for the organization and the work performed.

• There’s ample opportunity for each employee to learn and grow within the company.

• The organization has lower than average turnover rates (perpetuated by a healthy culture).

Consistency (internal focus/stable)

• The organization has consistent ways of doing things to get great results.

• There’s a high degree of coordination and integration.

• Strong communication exists with all employees regarding processes, decisions, policies, and company issues.

• Aligned and transparent leaders possess a sense of direction and purpose; they walk the talk.

• The organization has one perspective and focus.

You can use the Denison model to help you assess a company’s culture, which can be a bit of a detective exercise. Use these four organizational traits to help you categorize what you notice in the company you’re assessing, and match the way the company works with how you like to work. When we first talked to Pep he said he knew that the company he was considering was a great fit for him from the beginning. Everything he saw resonated with him – how many bikes were stored in the commute locker, the friendly, calm way his future teammates greeted him, his boss’s outfit, and the way the teams were organized. Pep loved being involved with others in his work and learning every day (Involvement). He instantly pictured himself as part of the company when he interviewed and felt at home from day one. Multiple small details about how they did things matched his style, which he described as “outdoorsy, active, informal, creative, and hardworking.” Pep had felt burdened in a previous job by too many rules. He liked to work independently and really valued a flexible schedule (Involvement). When we talked to Pep a few years later he still felt that the company embodied the right culture for him.

In short, Pep thrived in an organization where he had a great deal of autonomy to do great work (Involvement). His creative orientation responded well when he had room to think without constant criticism, and where his unique, divergent views were seen as important and he was often asked what he thought (Adaptability).

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• How would I assess my company in terms of its internal and external focus?

• How would I assess my company on the stability/flexibility spectrum?



We suggest you consider two important caveats when looking for a great culture fit:

• In addition to the company culture, there’s often a distinct work group or department culture that can be significantly different and also have a big impact on an employee working in that group. So consider the “local” as well as the overall culture of the organization.

• Describing a company as having a singular personality can be too narrow a parameter for a job seeker, since the essence of culture fit is complex, multi-faceted, historical, deeply personal, and dynamic.

Assess Your Culture Fit

Culture is one of the hardest elements of work fit to assess. You can feel that something is off but sometimes can’t put your finger on it. A terrific culture to one person can feel incompatible to another depending on personal needs, desires, and motivations. When you assess culture fit, look below the surface – look at how people act. We act from what we believe, which is deeply rooted in our values and manifested in company culture. By paying attention to the nuanced, under-the-surface attributes of a company, and rigorously knowing the kind of environment that works well for you, you’ll increase your likelihood of finding and thriving in a culture that’s great for you.



Checklist 5-1. Check all of the statements above that apply to you. Use the checklist as a reference as you progress in finding culture fit. You’ll return to your answers in a final assessment of your work fit in Chapter 13.

When evaluating how your company’s culture fits you, we suggest that you start with Checklist 5-1.
