Chapter One

According to Professor Lawrence Stone, director of Princeton University’s Shelby Cullom Davis Center for Historical Studies, between 1971 and 1976 more than nine hundred important books and articles were published on the subject of the history of childhood and family life. By contrast, he points out, in the 1930s only about ten scholarly books and articles were published each year.

In The Greek Way, Edith Hamilton tells a legend about a Greek painter that suggests there would have been nothing unusual about painting a boy: A Greek painter exhibited a picture of a boy holding a bunch of grapes so lifelike that birds flew down to peck at them. When the painter was praised for being a master, he replied, “If I were, the boy would have kept the birds away.” Miss Hamilton concludes from this legend that to the Greek mind nothing could be imagined to be as beautiful as the real. Grapes were to be painted to look like grapes, and boys to look like boys. But, in fact, we have no such paintings of boys—assuming our meaning of the word—from the Greek world.

Even as late as the nineteenth century, the tradition of reading as training for public speaking was still extant. The aim of the McGuffey Readers, for example, was to train the ear more than the eye.

Chapter Five

There appears to be some dispute about whether or not Morse actually transmitted this question. Indeed, one authority claims that Morse’s first public transmission expressed a quite different sentiment, his message being, “Attention Universe.”

Quoted from Dreadnaught Broadside, a pamphlet produced by students at the University of Toronto.

See Boorstin, The Image.

Barthes, p. 91.

Strictly speaking, the Semitic “alphabet” was a syllabary and not a true alphabet, but the changeover to phonetic literacy was nonetheless a major event in the psychological history of Western culture.

See Taylor’s The History of the Alphabet for a detailed discussion of the evolution of phonetic literacy.

See Havelock’s Origins of Western Literacy for a discussion of this point.

From a chapter in an unpublished book by Reginald Damerall of the University of Massachusetts.

Readers who are interested in the behavior of young children should consult the studies of Daniel R. Anderson, Department of Psychology, University of Massachusetts.

Mankiewicz and Swerdlow, p. 17.

Chapter Six

See Boorstin’s The Image for his development of the idea of the pseudo-event.

See the Singers and Zuckerman’s Teaching Television.

It is, of course, possible through government intervention to control television and thereby control the kind of information it will make accessible. Indeed, in most countries in the world that is exactly the case. But wherever and whenever television programming is free of rigid government restrictions, the American pattern is followed.

For an excellent treatment of how television makes available “back region” information, see Joshua Meyrowitz’s No Sense of Place: À Theory on the Impact of Electronic Media on Social Structure and Behavior, unpublished doctoral dissertation, New York University, 1978.

If one is willing to accept the current metaphors of genetics, then, of course, the question of who will be a male and who a female is also determined by information, i.e., genetic information.

Mead, p. 64.

See “Sexual Portrayals Using Children Legal Unless Obscene, Court Rules,” The New York Times, May 13, 1981, p. 1.

Bettelheim, p. 4.

As quoted in Mead, p. 64.

See Bernstein’s review in The Dial, Vol. 2, No. 6 (June 1981), pp. 46–49.

As quoted in Backstage, June 19, 1981, p. 60.

As quoted in The Des Moines Register, June 15, 1981, p. 7c.

Chapter Eight

See Leonide Martin’s Health Care of Women, p. 95. However, this widely held belief has been challenged by Vern L. Bullough of the State University of New York at Buffalo. See “Drop in Average Age for Girls’ Maturing Is Found to Be Slight,” The New York Times, July 11, 1981, p. 17.

See George Masnick and Mary Jo Bane’s The Nation’s Families: 1960–1990 for documentation of the decline of household members and the rise of the single-member household.

For documentation and analysis of the decline of the Disney empire, see “Wishing Upon a Falling Star at Disney,” The New York Times Magazine, November 16, 1980.

McDonald’s insists on keeping private its figures as to how much of its food different age groups consume. The best I could get from them is the statement that young adults with small children are the largest group among those who patronize McDonald’s. The categories McDonald’s inventories are small children, “tweens,” teens, young adults, and seniors.

These figures are from Nielsen Report on Television 1980.

Nielsen Report on Television 1981. Both this report and the 1980 report are available upon request to A. C. Nielsen Company, Nielsen Plaza, Northbrook, Illinois 60062.

According to RCA, the largest producer of classical music recordings, in the early 1960s the company released approximately eight new recordings a month. Today, that figure is down to four. A spokesman for RCA claims this situation is similar for every other company in the business. RCA also concedes that there has been a steady decline in the share of the market of both classical music and sophisticated popular music. Today, classical music, opera, and chamber music account for about seven percent of all sales. The rest is mostly rock, country, and jazz.

Among the many studies documenting this decline is one conducted by the California Department of Education in 1979. Seniors tested under the California Assessment Program continued to perform (as they had in 1978) sixteen percentage points below what the testing industry says is the national average for reading.

In a report released in 1981, the National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed that the inferential reasoning of thirteen-year-olds declined throughout the period of the 1970s.

For an excellent historical analysis of these relationships, see Sennett’s The Fall of Public Man.

These figures were compiled by using the 1950 and 1970 Uniform Crime Report (published by the FBI) and the 1950 and 1970 census.

See the New York Daily News, July 17, 1981, p. 5.
