17 Evaluating New Opportunities

When you make a choice, you change the future.

— Deepak Chopra

ONCE YOU’VE DECIDED that at this time in your life you’re in a job situation that’s a poor work fit for you, it’s time to begin evaluating other companies and opportunities. It’s time to ask yourself, “Where do I want to work next?” This seemingly easy task is, in reality, fraught with difficulties.

Susan said, “Everything looked great from the outside. I took the job and within two weeks I knew it was a bad fit. My boss was dishonest about how things were really done at the company, which was so disappointing because I had left a job I loved. It took five months, but I did leave. I hope that for my next job I’ll be better able to assess what I’m getting into before I say yes.” Things can look very, very different from the outside of an organization from what they actually are on the inside.

So how can you realistically assess whether a job or company you’re considering is going to be a great work fit for you, when all you have to go on is initial impressions from the interview process?

Key Actions for Evaluating Opportunities

Assuming that you’ve cultivated a short list of opportunities based on companies interested in you, industry or role choices that fit well for you, or places you have a likelihood of an interview, we suggest that you spend time on four key actions to increase the likelihood of finding a good fit for yourself.

Know What Work-Fit Elements Help You Thrive

Spend time, before you look at organizations, looking at yourself. What do you know about yourself that might make a difference in the culture fit for a particular company? Remember the values you identified in Chapter 12, “Knowing Yourself and What You Want”? We like to think of these as guiding lights that show you what you hold dear. If you land at a company that doesn’t consider a value of yours important, or at least relevant, you’ll likely feel misfit. While personal values are different from professed organizational values and serve a different purpose, the clearer you can be about the dimensions of work that you value highly, the more likely you’ll be able to look at a company with open eyes. As Brené Brown says, “A value is a way of being or believing that you hold most important.”

Do Your Homework

In today’s digital age there’s a lot of information about every organization available on the web. Do yourself a favor and read everything you can about the one’s you’re considering. Scour their websites to see what they say about themselves. Some companies with positive employer brands, such as Prudential (make sure to look at their careers page about fit) and Zappos (check out their incredible culture book), offer a plethora of interesting and telling information about themselves. Notice the story that unfolds for you as you read what they say about themselves and what others say about them. Read their blogs, watch their videos, and listen to the threads. Go to employment websites such as glassdoor.com and read what candidates say about them.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• What vibe do I get about what it’s like to work there every day?

• What are their stated values, and how do they synch with what matters to me?

• What unwritten rules does their messaging imply to me?



Talk to People

Once you land an interview, prepare a list of questions that will reveal the often invisible and undiscussed elements of an organization that really matter to fit. In addition, think about people you might talk to about the company, separate from the interview process – casual acquaintances, vendors you may know, recruiters, past employees, and others who may have experience with the company you’re considering.

Henry was considering joining a small software company, and as he went through interviews he learned of a few employees whom he knew socially in his community through kid events. He called them, asked them out for coffee, and spent time understanding what the company culture looked like from their points of view. Henry came to the get-togethers prepared with two or three good questions, but he spent most of the time simply listening to the stories that his acquaintances told him about the company. After talking to several people, he noticed threads that mattered to him. The company valued family time, and people flexed their hours accordingly. The executive team reportedly spoke freely and frequently to employees in open meeting spaces rather than in closed rooms. And performance reviews consisted of regular, two-way conversations between boss and employee about progress, goals, and personal dreams. Henry also discovered that people brought dogs to work, which, as a non-dog owner, he wasn’t sure about, but the observation intrigued him.

Ask the Right Questions

In your conversations with people you meet in the job process, as well as associates you may know from community, trade, or vendor relationships, the right questions make all the difference. Author Peter Block (2009) says, “The best questions are highly personal and deeply ambiguous.” This is never more true than when you’re attempting to assess an organization from the outside. You need to get people talking about the company, telling stories that help you get a window on, as well as a visceral experience of, what it’s really like to work there. These stories will help you to determine whether this is a place for you. One-word answers or yes/no questions won’t do this for you. (For sample starter questions by category, see Appendix 6, “Questions to Ask.”)

A Note About Company Ratings/Surveys

In the last 20-plus years, there has been a proliferation of best/great-places-to-work surveys hosted by third-party organizations, often media outlets. The phenomenon now known as Great Places to Work (see greatplacetowork.com) was launched by Robert Levering in his 1984 book 100 Best Companies to Work For, and the list started appearing in Fortune magazine in 1997. There are now numerous surveys hosted by media outlets and recruiting companies such as Glassdoor, Gallup, Business Week, Fortune, and Outside Magazine, as well as specialized and local newspapers and magazines (Schwartz 2011). These surveys are often voluntary, and companies participate based on employee responses, receiving results and rankings after the initial survey. Each particular survey measures workplaces in a slightly different way. For example, according to Levering, “A great place to work is one in which you trust the people you work for, have pride in what you do, and enjoy the people you work with.”

Tony Schwartz (2011), author and president of The Energy Project, defines twelve attributes of a truly great place to work in his Harvard Business Review article:

1. Pays a living wage

2. All employees have a stake in the company’s success

3. Safe, comfortable, and appealing work spaces

4. Healthy, high-quality food at the lowest possible price

5. Places for employees to rest and renew throughout the day

6. Ways for employees to move and stay fit

7. Clear and succinct expectations of what success looks like

8. Two-way performance reviews

9. Managers and leaders who are accountable

10. Time to think and focus

11. Opportunities to learn

12. Stands for something beyond profits

And researchers from Gallup (Flade, Harter, and Asplund 2014) report that there are seven things that great employers do that others don’t:

1. Have involved and curious leaders who want to improve.

2. Have cracking HR functions.

3. Ensure that the basic engagement requirements are met before expecting an inspiring mission to matter.

4. Never use a downturn as an excuse.

5. Trust, hold accountable, and relentlessly support managers and teams.

6. Have a straightforward and decisive approach to performance management.

7. Don’t pursue engagement for its own sake.

The Gallup researchers go on to say, “Our research in more than 160 countries shows that a job has the potential to be at the heart of a great life, but only if its holder is engaged at work.”

There are hundreds of employee motivation, engagement, and morale assessments on the market that are designed to assess various aspects of employee mindset, satisfaction, and connection to the organization. Many of these serve largely as comparative marketing assessments meant to attract candidates to one company over another. Some of these are highly susceptible to temporal changes such as bonuses given or leadership changes. We believe that employee engagement arises out of culture and not the other way around. Falling in love with a company because of a glossy magazine story about them is not the same thing as feeling content there day in and day out.

So, with all this data about what makes a company a great place to work, what’s a job seeker to do? Resist the urge to imagine yourself at a company with high ratings on a comparison survey without doing your due diligence to understand the actual culture and it’s appropriateness for you. What matters is whether you can tell if a company is a great place for you to work, which is ultimately impossible to discern from surveys or magazine rankings. To assess work fit from the outside requires you to take your research and discovery to new heights as you attempt to uncover whether an organization will be right for you, at this time, and why.



Figure 17-1. Three key actions will help you assess your potential work fit with a new organization.

We suggest three key actions to help you assess work fit from outside the organization: research, ask, and observe.

Research – You can research via the Internet, the media, and the public story the company itself publishes on social media and in annual reports, blogs, and internal documents such as employee handbooks. The onus is on you to act like a private investigator to find any and all relevant information on a prospective employer that can tell you what it’s like to work there, and whether it’s a great fit for you. The advent of digital and social media means that you can source a great deal of unsanctioned feedback about a company by reading what employees and others say online. When Trish was researching jobs, she scoured Facebook for evidence that the people she knew who worked there were unhappy, and pleasantly discovered no evidence in their day-to-day comments.

Ask – The ask process embodies the specific and powerful questions you should ask people you meet at the company through the selection process, as well as people you know who may have a connection to the company. The best questions are ambiguous and personal and reveal nuanced information about “what it’s like around here,” information that’s essential to your consideration of how well you’ll fit if you land there. When Marci asked a prospective organization about its flextime policy, she learned that, while they had a written policy, less than 1 percent of employees actually used it, a red flag for the potential to actually flex her schedule.

Observe – Observing an organization involves vigilant and thoughtful attention to how their employees interact with you as a candidate, with their customers, and with their vendors. The best indicator of what a company really values is how the people who work there behave in daily tasks. Observation is even more important than what the organization espouses in its formal communications. When Mac was considering applying to Les Schwab Tire Centers, he decided to go there as a customer to have his tires changed. He was impressed with the staff’s attitude and their customer focus, and that made him feel more confident that the people there walk the company talk in how they manifest the values of the organization.

In the evaluation phase, you’re often considering the interactions between multiple work-fit elements, but remember to examine each element independently as well.

Tips for Evaluating Each Work-Fit Element

Calculating the specifics of fit from outside the company when you’re evaluating a potential employer is similar to evaluating a job from the inside, but there are significant differences, and it takes a lot more work! The questions are different and the specifics are harder to uncover because you have limited access to how the company really does things. You need to go through this process for every potential employer you want to evaluate.

Assess Your Potential Meaning Fit

Research

• Read what the company says about its mission and how it matters.

• Research articles, blogs, and media stories about the purpose of the organization and why it exists.

• Become familiar with its products or services.

• Mystery shop or visit the storefront to assess the customer experience.

• What does the company say in published material about what matters to them (values statement, mission, vision, annual report, employee handbook)?

Ask

• Ask people you meet from the organization why they joined this company? Compare answers.

• Talk to current and past employees about the role that meaning plays in their jobs.

• Ask people who work there how they feel their job contributes to the mission of the organization.

• Ask people if they feel valued.

• Ask if managers have time for employees.

Observe

• Study the company’s products and/or services closely, and ask people who work there why they’re important.

• Notice how people informally talk about and connect to the organizational purpose.

• Look for evidence of meaning such as published values, inspiration, or company news.

• Do people seem to share themselves openly with others at work?

• Do people know each other’s names and say hello in passing?

Were a lot of items checked for the most important elements of fit? If so, the organization you’re assessing is likely to be a good fit for you.

Summary of Your Potential Work Fit Assessments

Congratulations on carefully considering the six elements of work fit as you explore a potential new employer. Let’s look at your totals using the table in Figure 17-2.

Consider what work-fit elements are the most important to you right now. Were a lot of items checked for these important elements?

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• What have I learned from these assessments?

• What’s the likelihood that this job will be a good work fit for me at this time?

• Are there areas where I’ve been overly optimistic?

• What are the risks if I’m wrong?



A 90-Day Research Project

Many employers have a 90-day probationary period during which an employee receives training, orientation, support, and feedback to ensure that they succeed on the job. If you decide, upon evaluation, to join a specific company and accept their offer, remember that it’s not a forever arrangement. Consider the first 90 days on the job as a mutual research project. It’s during this period that you and your new employer will get to know each other, and if there’s potential for work misfit it will likely rear its ugly head within the first 90 days. If you see or feel something that’s a red flag during this time, feel free to name it and work it out with your boss or team (see Chapter 15, “Flexing to Fit Where You Are”). And if the signs are extreme, at the end of the 90 days you can separate from the organization with less collateral damage than you (or they) would experience if you stayed longer.

With research revealing that many people will work for many organizations over the course of their lifetimes, it’s important to learn how to assess fit early in your tenure and to move swiftly if you find yourself misfit. As David said, “In retrospect, it was the best thing that happened to me every time I left a bad fit for something else.”

Pay Special Attention to Your Boss

Our research confirmed what’s been widely touted in management archives, journals, blogs, and articles: the relationship with your direct supervisor is absolutely critical to the degree of happiness, satisfaction, and connection you feel at work. The voices of unfulfilled and frustrated employees ring in our heads.

• I made the change to get away from an offensive manager.

• I had a boss who was abusive and it was demoralizing to be put down in front of others.

• A new boss didn’t value my contributions and discouraged discussion/agreement.





VERY IMPORTANT


It’s critical that you get to know and spend time with your immediate boss when you evaluate new opportunities!



Make sure, before you accept a new opportunity, that you’ve spent time getting to know your potential new boss beyond a hasty interview. Ask for time with them, and ask other people who work for them what they’re like. If it’s feasible, suggest an off-the-clock dinner or coffee, perhaps with spouses, to get to know the style and social dynamics of the person to whom you’ll report. Notice how they behave under stress, how they treat salespeople, and what their office looks like. Imagine yourself getting direction from or delivering bad news to them. How easy is it to engage? Do they make eye contact? Seem interested in you? Listen attentively? People who meet with a prospective boss at least three times before accepting a job do much better in assessing whether the partnership will be a good one over time.

A Word About Intuition

Steve Jobs (2005) said in his now famous Stanford commencement speech, “Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.” But when it comes to assessing work fit, many people struggle to trust their own instincts. We tend to second-guess ourselves, especially if our confidence has been shaken by a misfit work experience.

Amidst a backdrop of self-doubt, when we’re facing a change, it can be very difficult to pay attention to our instincts. These instincts evolve from our experience and wisdom formed over time. Merriam-Webster (2016) defines intuition as:

• A natural ability or power that makes it possible to know something without any proof or evidence: a feeling that guides a person to act a certain way without fully understanding why.

• Something that is known or understood without proof or evidence.

In order to assess a potential work situation, it’s important that you complete the analysis, checklists, and spreadsheets we’ve reviewed so far. Don’t shortchange this logical process and analysis. At the same time, it’s essential to find ways to tap into your own instincts about the fit. To do this you must give yourself permission to spend time thinking and feeling about the potential organization. Pay attention to your intuition without deceiving yourself about an opportunity. We frequently overplay what looks good and underplay warning signs. But if we carefully examine what our gut is telling us (intuition), we’ll be less likely to act hastily out of self-deception based on family, social, and internal pressures.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• What is my gut telling me about this?

• What makes my heart sing or delights me about this opportunity?

• How was my energy and flow after I met with people there?

• What am I telling others about the opportunity?

• Despite what other people say about this organization, can I picture myself there? Why or why not?



If you have trouble tapping into your gut instincts, try something new. For example, instead of list-making, sit quietly in a place you find relaxing and listen to your own thoughts. Listen to music, create art, or read or write poetry. Take a walk with a friend and talk about how you’re feeling about the opportunity.

When you evaluate a new organization, take your time if you can, and understand what’s at stake for you. When you find an organization that’s right for you, you’ll feel good. You’ll feel energetic most of the time, look forward to going to work, tell others about your great company, and feel happy.

In the words of others who worked hard to find a great work fit, it’s so worth the effort:

• I had a great relationship with my manager, who is invested in my development. Finds my strengths valuable, and compensates me enough with a very reasonable work-life balance. — Summer

• I’m proud to represent my company, my founders, and their drive. I want to work hard for them and exceed expectations, and I hope to stay here for a length of time. I frankly could see myself here for life, I’m that happy. It’s not perfect, but the things that are right for me, in sync with my style and values, are priceless to me. — Robin

• I was encouraged to do great work and utilize my strengths, challenged to stretch my knowledge and abilities, grow and learn. I always felt respected, but not always agreed with. Much laughter and authenticity among coworkers. Trust was built, valued, and maintained. — Nancy

• The term in the flow describes it well for me. Things are going well and normal daily obstacles feel solvable and manageable. I feel healthy and happy and productive both at work and at home. — Deborah

• It was great. I felt willing to go the extra mile and that my being there was valuable to them. What I brought to the table was of value. They truly cared about me and my work. I felt trusted. It seemed more like a family then a job. — Richard

• A sense of purpose, feeling valued, using the culmination of my past experiences and the ability to lead and coach others, allowing them growth opportunities in their own careers. — Cheryl

Put on your sleuth hat, center yourself to evaluate options, and dig in to assess potential next companies. Follow your intuition, ask your trusted advisors, listen, and bravely jump when it feels right. Remember, there’s no such thing as a perfect fit, so pay attention but don’t obsess about the details too much. Your journey to finding great work fit is an unfolding story. The destination is elusive and transient, but so worth its noble pursuit.
