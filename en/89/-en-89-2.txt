Two：The Origins of Liberty, Property and Justice

Nobody is at liberty to attack several property and to say that he values civilisation. The history of the two cannot be disentangled.

Henry Sumner Maine

Property . . . is therefore inseparable from human economy in its social form.

Carl Menger

Men are qualified for civil liberties, in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their appetites：in proportion as their love of justice is above their rapacity.

Edmund Burke
