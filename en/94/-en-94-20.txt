PHOTOGRAPHS


My father, Shen Jiang, stands on the far left of this photograph taken with his father, Shen Rong, and his siblings. The picture was taken soon after China’s revolution, during the initial good days before the Communists seized my grandfather’s house and shut down his law office.

Here I am in Hong Kong soon after my parents and I moved there. This picture was taken in the living room of my maternal grandfather’s apartment, where three families squeezed into a 750-square-foot space. We slept in the living room.

This photograph is of the Queen’s College annual swim meet held at the pool in Victoria Park, Hong Kong, across the road from my high school. I’m fifteen and I won it. The man presenting me the award is Henry Fok, a businessman who in the 1950s made a fortune breaking the trade embargo against Communist China.

This is a classic Chinese-style portrait of Whitney with her parents—her mother, Li Baozhen, and her stepfather, Duan Xiangxi. Whitney’s mother fled her biological father when she was still pregnant with Whitney.

Whitney had this photograph taken of her on Tiananmen Square in the late 1990s. Just by her pose, you can tell she’s carefree, confident, and, with her brightly colored frock, ahead of her time.

This picture of me—on the left—was taken after I’d graduated from the University of Wisconsin and had returned to Hong Kong to take a job as a stockbroker. Competitive drinking was part of life in Hong Kong during those go-go years. Most of the others in the picture came from the United States, seeking their fortunes in the Far East.

A relatively early photograph of the Wen family, including China’s premier, Wen Jiabao; his wife, Zhang Beili (whom we called Auntie Zhang); their son, Winston Wen; and their daughter, Wen Ruchun. Given Wen’s Mao jacket, the picture was probably taken when Wen was still working in the General Office of the Chinese Communist Party.

This picture of Premier Wen Jiabao was taken in 2008, after a deadly earthquake in Sichuan Province. Wen was viewed as a hardworking man of the people. After news broke of his family’s wealth, he was much criticized but seemed, to us, not entirely aware of what had been going on.

This picture depicts the initial public offering of Ping An Insurance Company on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Ma Mingzhe, far right, is banging the gong. Ping An’s listing on the Shanghai exchange meant a windfall for Whitney and me worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

We are in Paris in June 2011 doing a vertical tasting of Château Lafite Rothschild, starting with a 1900 and ending with a 1990. The wines alone that night ran to more than $100,000. On the left, David Li Botan is sitting with his wife, Jia Qiang. I’m on the right with Whitney and developer Xu Jiayin and his wife, Ding Yumei. My French friend François is sitting across from me on the left.

Whitney wanted a Rolls, so we purchased a similar model for an enormous markup due to hefty import taxes. I felt it was ostentatious, but, like most of the purchases we made during those years, the car was meant to establish a certain status, which the system required to do business at the highest levels.

Chinese mega-artist Zeng Fanzhi stands between two of his paintings. Whitney bought the painting on the left, Praying Hands , for about $5 million. She outbid a major European art collector and businessman. These purchases were meant to signal we had the resources to make the biggest deals happen.

This photograph of Beijing Capital International Airport shows the northern part of the airfield, which we built to handle cargo. Over the course of several years, our firm developed 6 million square feet of warehouses, cargo terminals, and offices.

This is the library at Tsinghua University that Whitney and I built with a $10 million donation. It has become the most popular library on campus and students have to go online to reserve a study cubicle.

Here I am voting as a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. I was a member of this group for a decade. We voted every year, but the votes didn’t mean anything. We voted yes to all proposals. Most of us used membership on the conference to network.

This is the Genesis development project, the capstone of Whitney’s and my career in Beijing. On the right is the residence and the hotel; in the center is one of the office towers. This project allowed us to exercise our creativity to the fullest in leaving behind something stunning in China’s capital.

This is a picture looking into the lobby of the Genesis office building. Whitney disappeared from this entrance on September 5, 2017.

Our friend Sun Zhengcai was destined to be China’s number one or two political official starting in 2022. But his rise was derailed by a corruption investigation that clearly benefited Party boss Xi Jinping. Here, Sun is in court. He was sentenced to life.

I’d once participated in Communist Party–organized protests against democracy in Hong Kong. But here I am marching for freedom and democracy in Hong Kong on June 9, 2019.
