78：Uncertainty：Twitter, July–September 2022




Ari Emanuel hosing Musk down in Mykonos



Alex Spiro





The terminator


Unsure what he wanted to do about Twitter, Musk asked for three options in June 2022. Plan A was to proceed as agreed with a $44 billion purchase. Plans B and C involved trying to reprice the deal or to get out of it entirely, somehow. To help do the financial modeling for those options, he brought in Bob Swan, a former CEO of eBay and Intel and a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which was investing in Musk’s offer.

The problem was that Swan, a straight shooter, was committed to Plan A. He felt there was no real justification for getting out of the deal. He accepted most of the numbers in Twitter’s proxy statement, applied a bit of a discount, and presented a somewhat rosy financial model. Musk, convinced that the world was entering a recession and that Twitter was misstating its bot problem, challenged Swan angrily. “If you can present this to me with a straight face, then you’re probably not the guy for the job,” he said.

Swan had been too successful to be treated that way. “Since I presented this to you with a straight face, you’re right,” he responded. “I’m probably not the right guy for the job.” And he quit.

Once again, Musk put in a call to his close friend and early Tesla investor Antonio Gracias, whose SWAT team had uncovered the problems at Tesla in 2007. Gracias was vacationing in Europe with some of his kids when the call came. “You said when you left the Tesla board that I should call you if I need help,” Musk reminded him. Gracias agreed to put together a team to do a deep dive on Twitter’s finances.

Gracias felt he needed to enlist an independent investment bank to help sort through the proper valuation and capital structure. He talked to his friend Robert Steel of Perella Weinberg Partners, who in his straightforward way asked Musk directly what his goal was: to get out of buying Twitter or to buy Twitter at a lower price? Musk said he wanted the latter option. That was true, at least most of the time, but he was constrained, both legally and psychologically, from saying something even truer, namely that there were some mornings, and some nights, when he felt that he may have stumbled onto a fool’s errand and would be happy if the whole thing went away. Steel had an interesting insight about Musk. When most clients are given three or four options, they will ask which one the banker recommends. Musk, instead, asked detailed questions about each option but did not solicit a recommendation. He liked to make his own decision.

When Musk demanded the raw data and methodology for determining how many real users it had, Twitter provided floods of data in formats that his team deemed almost unusable. Musk used this as a pretext for trying to withdraw from the deal. “For nearly two months, Mr. Musk has sought the data and information necessary to make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts,” his lawyers wrote. Twitter’s resistance meant that Musk was exercising his “right to terminate the Merger Agreement.”

Twitter’s management responded by suing Musk in Delaware’s chancery court, charging that he “refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.” Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick set a trial for October.

Musk’s business manager Jared Birchall and lawyer Alex Spiro tried to restrain him from sending texts and tweets that would undermine his case by suggesting that the reason he wanted out of the deal was because advertising was collapsing and the economy declining. “I’m calling him right now to tell him no more tweeting,” Spiro told Birchall one day. But Spiro was an overmatched lion tamer. Within ten minutes, Musk sent a barrage of tweets that almost seemed designed to spite his legal team. “So much for the conversation about tweeting,” Birchall told Spiro.

Even Musk’s wacky unrelated tweets became a problem. “I’m buying Manchester United ur welcome,” he posted in August. Birchall called Spiro to ask if the SEC might see that as an improper disclosure. “Is he really going to?” Spiro asked. It turned out that Musk was just riffing on a meme about how Manchester United fans were always begging people to buy the team. Spiro made him send a follow-up tweet: “No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I’m not buying any sports teams.”





Ari Emanuel wades in


Ari Emanuel is often referred to as a Hollywood superagent, but by 2022 he had become more than that. He was the CEO of Endeavor, a sprawling entertainment enterprise, and he was so plugged in that he never ran out of energy. With his high-pitched and fast-paced ability to connect people and drop f-bombs, talents he shared with his brothers Rahm and Zeke, he exulted in dipping his fingers in every interesting pie.

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he decided he didn’t want to be giving the Saudis more oil money, so he traded in his Ferrari for a Prius. But he hated the car. It was too wimpy. He was looking for someone who would actually make a great electric vehicle, and that’s when he read about Musk. “I do what I normally do, which is create serendipity,” Emanuel says. “I called him up and said, ‘I want to meet you.’ We were just two young pishers trying to fucking figure it out, and we became friends.” Emanuel put in an order for a Tesla Roadster, “because I wanted to fucking get out of that goddamn Prius,” and ended up in 2008 taking delivery of the eleventh one. He still has it.

In May 2022, Musk flew to Saint-Tropez, France, for the celebrity-packed (Sean “Diddy” Combs, Emily Ratajkowski, Tyler Perry) wedding of Emanuel and fashion designer Sarah Staudinger. The Cannes Film Festival made it a hot time to be on the Riviera. Musk met for lunch with Natasha Bassett, the Australian actress who was with him in Hawaii a month earlier when he decided to go hostile on Twitter.

Curb Your Enthusiasm comedian Larry David, who was officiating at the wedding, was at Musk’s table, and when they sat down, David seemed to be fuming. “Do you just want to murder kids in schools?” he asked Musk.

“No, no,” Musk stuttered, both baffled and annoyed. “I’m anti–kid murder.”

“Then how could you vote Republican?” David asked.

David confirms that he confronted Musk. “His tweets about voting Republican because Democrats were the party of division and hate were sticking in my craw,” he says. “Even if Uvalde never happened, I probably would have brought it up, because I was angry and offended.”

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough was also at the table, and David described the encounter to him. Scarborough found it all pretty amusing. “I had told Ari I was not a big fan of Elon, so he seated me with him,” he laughs. “Elon stayed pretty quiet.” For his part, Emanuel says he wasn’t trying to stir up trouble. “I actually thought that would be a great table.” It ended up being a microcosm of Twitter.

There was another issue at the wedding. Among the guests was Egon Durban, a venture capitalist who was a big Twitter shareholder and on its board. Musk was angry because, he said, Durban had badmouthed him to Morgan Stanley’s CEO, James Gorman. Emanuel tried to repair the damage at the wedding. “You’re being a fucking fool,” he told Durban. “Go over and talk to him.” They had a twenty-minute conversation, during which, according to Musk, “he tried to kiss my ring,” but their tension did not get resolved.

A dealmaker by nature, Emanuel offered to facilitate back-channel negotiations between Musk and Twitter’s board. He asked Musk how much he would be willing to pay for Twitter. Perhaps there was a discount to be negotiated, below the $44 billion that the board had accepted. Musk suggested perhaps half that price. Neither Durban nor the rest of the Twitter board thought that even merited a response.

Emanuel tried to jump-start the negotiations again in July, when he invited Musk to come to a vacation house he had in Mykonos, Greece. Musk flew from Austin and spent two days, which were made memorable when he was photographed on a yacht looking pale and blubbery alongside Emanuel, who looked preternaturally trim and tanned.

Musk told Emanuel that he might be willing to strike a deal with Twitter rather than proceed with the October trial in Delaware. Emanuel again called Durban, who was not in favor of trying to negotiate a lower price. But some other board members were eager to see if there was a way to avoid the bloody battle, and so they let informal settlement talks begin.





Going for it


Musk’s negotiations with Twitter to lower the price of the deal did not get far. The company made some proposals that could have reduced the $44 billion price by about 4 percent, but Musk insisted that the reduction had to be more than 10 percent before he would consider it. At certain moments, it seemed there might be ways to get the two sides closer, but there was an additional problem. If the deal was restructured or repriced, it would allow the banks that had committed to provide loans to renegotiate the terms. The commitments had been made when interest rates were low, so the new interest rates they would charge might wipe out any savings.

There was also a more emotional obstacle. Twitter’s executives and board members insisted that any renegotiated deal must protect them from future lawsuits from Musk. “We are never going to give them a legal release,” Musk said. “We will hunt every single one of them till the day they die.”

Throughout September, Musk was on the phone with his lawyers Alex Spiro and Mike Ringler three or four times a day. Some days he was in an aggressive mood and insisted that they could fight and win the case in Delaware. Revelations from a whistle-blower and others had inflamed his conviction that Twitter had been lying about the number of bots. “They are shitting bricks about the dumpster fire they’re in,” he said of the Twitter board. “I cannot believe that the judge will railroad the deal through. It would not pass muster with the public.” At other times, he thought they should go through with the deal and then sue the Twitter board and management for fraud. Perhaps he would even be able to claw back some of his purchase price from them later. “The problem,” he said angrily, “is that the board members own so little of the stock that recovering from them would be difficult.”

His lawyers finally convinced him at the end of September that he would lose the case if they took it to trial. It was best just to close the deal on the original terms, $54.20 a share, $44 billion in total. By that point Musk had even regained some of his enthusiasm about taking over the company. “Arguably, I should just pay full price, because these people running Twitter are such blockheads and idiots,” he told me in late September. “Its stock was seventy last year with such a ship of fools. The potential is so great. There are so many things I could fix.” He agreed to an official closing of the deal in October.

Once it was clear that the deal was going through, Ari Emanuel came back to Musk, in a three-paragraph message sent on the encrypted text service Signal, with a proposal: let him and his agency Endeavor run Twitter. For a fee of $100 million, he said, he would take charge of cutting costs, creating a better culture, and managing relations with advertisers and marketers. “We’d operate it, but he would tell us what he wanted and be in charge of all the engineering and technical stuff,” Emanuel says. “We do a ton of business with advertisers, and it’s not like we haven’t done this before, you know?”

Birchall called it “the most insulting, demeaning, insane message.” Musk was more sanguine and polite. He valued his friendship with Emanuel. “Look, I appreciate the offer,” he said. “But Twitter is a tech company, a programming company.” Emanuel countered that they could just hire the tech people, but Musk gave him a firm no. He had a core belief that you could not separate engineering from product design. In fact, product design should be driven by engineers. The company, like Tesla and SpaceX, should be engineering-led at all levels.

There was another thing that Emanuel did not understand. Musk wanted to run Twitter himself, just as he was doing with Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink.
