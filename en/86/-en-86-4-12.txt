12 Knowing Yourself and What You Want

Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.

— Carl G. Jung

SOME PEOPLE JUST GET LUCKY – they find the right job for them, at the right time, and they can’t imagine doing anything else. Rachel told us that she applied for a writing job right after graduating from college, got it, and after five years remains absolutely delighted with everything about the role. The people are her friends, the lifestyle supports her personal needs, she feels that she’s paid fairly, and the work is drop-dead interesting.

For most people, the positive experience of loving your job frequently happens when you truly understand yourself. It’s noteworthy that people experience less work misfit with age. Most of us, over time, develop a deeper understanding of ourselves, our needs, and the environment in which we thrive, which enables us to focus more intensely on how to partner well with others, be altruistic, listen, and take risks that facilitate a positive work fit.

When we feel miserable at work, it’s all too easy to focus our energy on the flaws in our company or our job in a “grass is always greener on the other side” phenomenon that can result in fast, even reckless, moves from one job to another. Before you jump out of one difficult situation of misfit into another it’s worth spending time getting to know yourself. There are two parts to work fit for you to explore: understanding your unique self and knowing the organization you belong to or want to join. In this way, fit is akin to a lock and a key, or a foot and a shoe – unless you know yourself, it’s hard to find the place you fit best. Looking in the mirror and asking hard questions about work fit will enable you to efficiently and proactively ensure that you’re taking steps that make sense and, above all else, won’t land you in an even worse situation.

In 1989, Professor Ed Tomey of Antioch University New England inspired Moe with a statement she’ll always remember: “There are two critical questions to being effective at work: Who am I? and Who am I with you?” Our research took us back repeatedly to the critical role of the first question – Who am I? – in discovering great work fit. Self-discovery is a lifelong process that forms in layers, over time, as we mature and grow.

We found the following personal characteristics to be particularly helpful for understanding yourself as you consider whether a job is right for you, or as you search for a new company or role. These are:

• Your Personal Strengths and Impact on Others – Knowing what you’re really good at, understanding where you need to change, and realistically assessing the impact you have on others are key to assessing work fit.

• Your Life Stage – Your needs for income, adventure, stability, learning, travel, and many other variables change as you get older.

• Your Flexibility Needs – Understanding your ability to be flexible (travel, varied work hours) or your need for your job to be flexible (freedom to set your own work hours) will help you determine what to look for in a job or organization.

• Your Learning and Development Needs – The basic human need to grow and evolve varies by individual and circumstances, and knowing what you need can make a difference between a miserable stuck feeling and a delightful work fit.

• Your Aspirations and Dreams – Oftentimes, where you are today with your work situation is a waypoint on the path to where you dream of being. Aspirations inspire, motivate, and matter.

Personal Strengths and Impact

The ancient Greek aphorism “know thyself” has been attributed to many, and it has stood the test of time as a maxim for basic human effectiveness. In fact, understanding your own needs, desires, preferences, and opinions helps you better interact with others. When you realistically assess your inner motivations and outer impact, you foster a great capacity for positive influence in your environment and with the people around you. Daniel Goleman, researcher and writer in the realm of emotional intelligence, defines self-awareness as the first big step toward more effectively navigating relationships in the world. Self-awareness is essential in navigating your search for the right job. It’s tempting to think of self-awareness primarily as noticing your weaknesses or growth needs, but it’s important to also focus on understanding and appreciating your strengths and assets.

Malcolm told us that when he hit 35 he knew he needed a job change, but he really wasn’t sure what kind of change was going to be best for him. Work was becoming less and less fulfilling, and he noticed that he was thinking a lot about retirement, which was still a long way off. A friend suggested that he consider an in-depth personality assessment system such as the Enneagram (see enneagraminstitute.com), and through his company he was able to gather 360-degree feedback about his leadership impact. This system provided nuanced dimensions of self-knowledge and awareness for Malcolm, helping him to identify his core personal needs, his natural leadership strengths, and the environment he would most likely thrive in.

As Malcolm discovered, there are many ways that you can deepen your self-knowledge and awareness. Doing so will facilitate a more rigorous and honest exploration of the best environment, role, and organization for you.

We each bring unique human qualities to how we approach our work. Beyond the specifics of executing tasks based on our knowledge, training, and experience, how we work includes the varied ways we might resolve an issue. Certain approaches work better in some work environments than others, and the extent to which we know our natural inclinations and habits will determine how we show up in a work situation. This aspect of self-exploration is avoided by many of us since we often don’t have time at work to think about our own impact – the pace and volume of work squeeze out reflective time. Developing a practice of claiming time to think about yourself and your ideal work setting will increase your odds of finding a positive work fit.

Tools to Help You Become More Self-Aware

Get a Personality or Style Assessment

There are a number of cost-effective, reliable, and valid personality or behavioral style assessments on the market today. These are often completed online, cost from $25 to $85 per person, and only take about 30 minutes to score. Our favorites include the Everything DiSC Workplace Assessment distributed by Wiley Publishing, the Hogan (measuring “the dark side, the bright side, and the inside”), the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal distributed by Talent Smart, Strengths Finder by Gallup, and the Enneagram. Whatever assessment tool you choose, you’ll want a statistically reliable assessment (your scores are consistent over time) that has high face validity (it feels accurate when you read it). Appendix 3, “Assessment Tool Comparison Chart” helps you compare the different assessment tools.

When completing a self-assessment, remember to stay focused while you score it, and think about yourself in the context of your specific situation. All of these assessments are accompanied by a thorough report with suggestions for applying the concepts in your life, and most will also suggest an expert to assist in interpreting your results. Behavioral or personality assessments describe nuanced aspects of you, and expert interpretation can help you map your unique traits to the cultural or other work qualities that are a great fit for you.

Find a Peer Coach or a Peer Group

Another cost-effective tool for self-awareness is a peer group in your profession or a friend or colleague who will serve as a peer coach as you examine your strengths, assets, and opportunities. Counsel this coach on what you’re seeking to learn more about yourself, share with them any assessment information you have, and ask them to provide support in your quest to understand yourself. Some possible questions to provide them include:

• Do you think this assessment reflects how you see me? Why or why not?

• I feel that my strengths and weakness are_________. What else do you see as my strengths and weaknesses as a colleague or team member?

• What do you know about me that I may not be able to see on my own? What impact do I have on others?

• What feedback do you have for me about the kind of work environment in which I seem to do my best?

• What sometimes bugs you about how I behave, and do you think that I should work on this?

What matters the most is establishing an explicit agreement for support on a particular issue – in this case, self-awareness as a prerequisite to finding a great work fit. We suggest an explicit request with a defined duration, for example, “Jamie, I wonder if you would be willing to meet with me for two sessions in the next four weeks to help me increase my self-awareness as I contemplate my job situation.”

Ask Around Often

Even if you don’t ask one person to be your peer coach, another way to develop self-awareness is to ask people around you for their perspectives and opinions about you. People you trust, who have your best interests at heart, are usually the best sources for realistic and helpful feedback about the impact you have, the strengths they love, and the things they find challenging about you. Rarely do we see or experience ourselves the way others do. Much like a singer whose voice sounds different to them than it does to an audience, the best way to understand your impact is to ask others openly and honestly about it. Doing so puts you in a position of vulnerability, which researcher Brené Brown defines as “uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.” Making yourself vulnerable calls for courage. So, take a deep breath and remember your end goal (self-awareness) and start asking people what they notice about you (really!). What you learn will be enormously useful; it’s not a score of positives or negatives that you seek, but the most accurate, unbiased picture possible of the complex being that is you.

Some questions to start with are:

• What do you see as my natural gifts?

• What do you think makes me hard to work with?

• Based on what you know about my work situation right now, where do you see me thriving or struggling?

• What’s your biggest wish for me for my work situation?

• I’m working on changing my behavior regarding ____________. Have you noticed any improvement or change lately?

• What else do you think that I can do to be more effective in that arena?





360-Degree Feedback


Another excellent option for building self-awareness is to get 360-degree feedback via a multi-rater assessment by your boss, colleagues, direct reports, and others. This kind of assessment gives you insights into the impact you have on others in a confidential and anonymous way, and it’s particularly useful for people in leadership roles. With a price ranging from $250 to $580 (in addition to the costs of expert interpretation and coaching), 360-degree feedback can be a fast, effective, and valuable reality check as to how you come across, your strengths, and the things that get in your way. We recommend using a third-party coach or consultant to administer the assessment, and our favorites include the Leadership Practices Inventory, the Hogan Lead, 360 Refined, and the Center for Creative Leadership’s Benchmarks Suite.

If you have a 360-degree assessment done on yourself, remember to take notice of your strengths as well as your weaknesses. Most of us tend to focus on criticism, but being able to objectively understand what you do well can greatly increase the positive impact you have. By understanding through the lens of other people how you come across, you’ll be able to make positive changes where necessary to increase your effectiveness, while you also gain insight into the type of situation in which you’ll flourish. Ken, a coaching client, said it this way: “When I got the feedback from the 360 it confirmed what I already knew but hadn’t been willing to admit to myself. I do best in an environment with clear processes and structure. Without these in place in my current company, I had become a bit of a micromanaging boss. This made it hard for folks who worked for me. I either needed to lead differently or find an environment in which my need for rules was more practical. A tech start-up was not that place!”

Hire a Professional

If you have personal financial resources or company support, it can help to hire a coach to assist you in gathering data and feedback that will heighten your self-awareness and self-understanding. Coaching is a one-to-one process of support and guidance that can help you make progress toward your specific goal or behavior change. We recommend a trained professional who operates from a best-practice code of ethics and who is experienced with situations such as yours. Consider asking your employer’s people development or HR department for help in finding a coach, and ask colleagues whom you admire what resources they might recommend for self-development. You may want to familiarize yourself with the standards of the International Coach Federation and interview a coach to determine if they’re a good match for you. Executive coaching can cost anywhere from $200 to $600 per hour, and a personal life coach can cost between $75 and $300 per hour (Rothman and WanVeer 2008). You’ll get the most value out of coaching if you employ regular intervals of learning, practice, discussion, and application. Coaching often lasts several months.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Which of these approaches to learning more about me is appealing?

• What steps might I take to get started?



Stage of Life

Most of us seek work fit during our adult years, which is our longest period of human development. But adulthood is not one long unbroken block of unchanging needs and desires; it’s filled with nuanced stages. In our research and experience we’ve discovered the following approximate stages of adult, work-related development:

• Exploration – These are our early years of professional development, when we’re selecting a career while we’re still in school or testing options after school. In this period flexibility is key as we try new things. We’re often not financially independent and may be underpaid in our work (internships, for example). Meaning often surfaces in this stage as a priority, as we assess what matters to us in the world and where and how we want to contribute.

• Early Real Life – It’s in this stage that we often begin to settle into a specific career or field. We’re financially independent, and we’re highly flexible if we don’t yet have the responsibilities of spouse, partner, or children. Our direction is unfolding, and we have likely landed in one occupation, at least for now,

• Milestone – In this period, we often enter parenting or partnering, and we may seek a more permanent residence or less rigorous or lengthy travel. We often seek core stability, if not permanence, and are accumulating jobs and experience that matter to our resume and reputation. Many people move from being an individual contributor at work to being a manager or leader. Flexible work hours may be important during early parenting years. And many workers are proving their competence in this stage as they develop a reputation with capstone or reward moments (advanced degrees, honorary awards, etc.).

• Maturing – At this stage, some people transition out of full-time work arrangements. They may become caregivers for older parents, becoming part of the sandwich generation (caring for their parents and their children at the same time). People can find new meaning at this stage as they seek to give back to the community or leave a legacy.

As we transition from one stage of life to another, our needs change, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that we’ll need to change jobs. Ideally, as our needs and interests change our workplace will support and enable these changes through projects, promotions, new areas of responsibility, or even job shifts. This way we’ll maintain our feelings of positive fit.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Which life stage am I in right now?

• How might my current life stage affect my ranking of the six elements of work fit?



Your stage of life isn’t dependent on your age, but rather it’s determined by the types of activities and work that you’re doing at the time. You can change your circumstance at any age (have a family, divorce, pursue an advanced degree, etc.), which can change your needs, interests, and inter-dependencies, and, as a result, change what you need from your work.

Our stage of life is different for each of us. Susan said, “I was a new mother and was unable to work remotely one day a week. This felt irrational to me, so I moved on.” Or consider Daniel, who said, “I couldn’t continue at that job, because of its intensity, while continuing my education.” And Marilyn spoke about the interdependency of stage of life and work fit: “I felt I outgrew my last role. I had a great relationship with my boss and team, a lot of leadership and visibility, but there was no more room for growth, which mattered more to me as I matured.” Carefully consider what matters to you at your particular stage of life so that you know, realistically, what kind of job or company will feel best for you at that time.

Most of us will have many jobs over the course of our lives, so it’s helpful to adopt an “it all made sense at the time” attitude when you pick a job based on your stage of life. What make sense when you’re young, single, and motivated to travel and learn may not make sense at all when you’re mid-career, carrying high financial obligations, and eager to ensure a safe retirement. Long gone are the days of having one career, much less one job lasting for our entire adult life. Loyalty alone is no longer keeping workers in place in organizations; instead, stage of life, work-life balance, personal ambition, and an interest in learning have become the components of thriving in a job.

The skill of being able to notice, describe, and proclaim what matters to you at a particular stage of life will help you to determine whether a role is a good fit for you. Doing so may mean that you change jobs more often than your parents did, or, in some cases, you may stay put. The important thing is to consider whether your job is meeting your needs at your stage of life, rather than assume that one job will satisfy your changing needs.

Flexibility Needs

In our high-tech, global, services-based economy, control over your work schedule is a key determinant of work fit. Flexibility includes the ability to control your work arrival and departure times, the chance to take midday time for personal or caregiving needs, work-at-home options, and other strategies that enable you to do the things that you need and want to do. Understand your habits, responsibilities, commute requirements, and productivity traits so that you can assess what type of flexibility at work matters to you.

Recent research, such as an Ernst and Young study of 9,700 employees in the world’s largest economies, suggests that flexibility is an increasingly important currency for workers (Sahadi 2015). And in their article “A Revolutionary Change: Making the Workplace More Flexible,” authors Jolynn Shoemaker, Amy Brown, and Rachel Barbour (2011) suggest that “We need leaders who understand that adaptability is necessary in a rapidly changing world and that workplace flexibility is a key component of keeping pace with change.” One of the assumptions of the accountability model developed by Brown and Barbour is “That all workers will need to adjust the time they spend doing paid and unpaid work at various stages of their lives.” They also emphasize that it’s important that companies change policies and practices over time that leverage the benefits of enhanced workplace flexibility. Flexibility is increasingly important.

For some workers, flexibility includes the ability to work at home on some days. For others flexibility takes the form of being able to modify their schedule based on caregiving, educational, recreational, or other needs, in particular being able to change arrival and departure times.

At the center of the flexibility dimension of work fit is the desire of people to manage the expectations of their jobs along with their caregiving duties. While caregiving has historically been primarily the responsibility of women, more and more men are now seeking creative workplace options that allow them to manage the entirety of their lives, including caregiving, rather than sacrificing their family and personal obligations to work long, untenable hours. Anne Marie Slaughter has written extensively on the changing cultural and structural patterns that continue to face working parents, especially women. Slaughter (2015) writes, “Real flexibility – the kind that gives you at least some measure of control over when and how you work in a week, a month, a year and over the course of a career – is a critical part of the solution of how to fit work and care together.”

To assess your need for flexibility ask yourself these questions:

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Can I work regular daytime hours every day?

• What schedule works best for me and my productivity habits?

• Do I have outside interests or caregiving demands that would be well served by a particular type of flexibility?

• How do I feel about commute time?

• Do I prefer working at home?



Learning Needs and Opportunity to Progress

What Abraham Maslow first defined as self-actualization needs (realizing personal potential, self-fulfillment, peak experiences, and personal growth) remain critical aspects of successful work fit. Most of us seek to progress throughout our lives rather than stagnate. According to our research, people who left a job most often cited a lack of opportunity to grow as their reason for job unhappiness. And people who were happy at their jobs rated their opportunity to learn and grow as a top reason for their contentment. Mary said it this way, “My exit was less about a poor fit than it was that I grew out of the place. After 12 years, I just didn’t think I was learning, and, in fact, neither was the company. That’s just bad all around.”

If you’re feeling stagnant in your role you’re not alone. Training programs and opportunities to grow are frequently rated as critical elements for finding a good fit at work (Deloitte 2016), but we’re not always able to focus on learning because of other priorities and pressures. There are times when we’re busily tending to other dimensions of our lives, and simply doing our jobs and going home at night is all we can handle. So how can you think of learning at work?

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• What are the aspects of my current role that I find stimulating and keep my interest?

• What kinds of new things do I get to do at work that are interesting to me?

• How and how often do I and my boss discuss my development?



Aspirations and Dreams

As we interviewed people about work fit, we were amazed to find that many landed in their most successful roles through a series of accidents. In fact, the simple act of moving on from a misstep is an essential element of resilience and growth. One person described it as “several key game-show-like decisions: what’s behind door number 1, 2, or 3. I randomly chose, and over the years the resultant path has made total sense.”

We often choose jobs based on our current circumstances, stage of life, job availability, and other interdependent variables, hoping that the direction we’re moving will turn out well. In many cases, because of the trade-offs we make for work fit, we find ourselves in a job that’s clearly just a waypoint on a road taking us somewhere else. Pete was a maritime engineer who worked at an engineering firm in Philadelphia right out of college. His dream was to work as a chief mate or second mate on a tanker, but he felt that he should cut his teeth by working in an engineering house shoreside to show his ability to work analytically and to build his resume. Or consider Wendy, who took a job as a programmer early in her career even though her hope was to be an analyst working with big data. To be seen at a future date as a candidate for big data jobs, Wendy needed to prove herself on the programming battlefield first.

Each job decision we make matters, but they’re not usually catastrophic. In fact, our research tells us that it’s the jobs people picked that are a poor fit that often result in them finding a great fit. The contrast helps us discover what’s best for us, and it also helps us clarify our hopes, dreams, and fantasies. Many of us fail to allow ourselves to imagine our wildest dreams, but allowing ourselves to think big and dream can often create the motivation and the space to get closer to them than we imagined possible. If you haven’t done so already, consider the long-term view – where you’re heading and what your life’s goals are – and spend some time crystalizing your thinking by asking questions like these:

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Where do I see myself when I think ahead to my dream job in ten years?

• Are there credentials or experiences that I lack that are required for that job?

• What lifestyle and financial dimensions will matter to me in ten years?

• Are there dreams that my partner, friends, family, and I share that could impact the work I pursue?

• What risks am I willing to take to achieve this dream?



A great work fit means that you’re learning and growing. Every job has boring aspects on any given day, but what matters for great work fit is an overall feeling that you’re increasing your capacity, and thereby fulfilling a basic human need.

Consider doing the exercise in Figure 12-1 as you imagine your ideal work fit.

Notice which parts of your ideal day matter deeply to you. These items are likely representative of some of your deeply held values and act as guiding lights to what you hold dear. If you land at a company that doesn’t consider a value of yours important, or at least relevant, you’ll likely feel misfit. While personal values are different from organizational values and serve a different purpose, the clearer you can be about the dimensions of work that you value highly, the more likely you’ll be able to evaluate a potential company with open eyes.

What Gets in the Way of Self-Awareness?

It’s a rigorous journey, this voyage toward self-awareness. It requires honesty, energy, openness, and humility. Watch out for barriers to increasing your self-awareness – these barriers can impact your ability to find the work situation that’s ideal for you at this time in your life. The primary things that people told us got in the way are:



Figure 12-1. This exercise will help you image what your ideal work fit looks like.

• Ego and Lack of Humility – It’s easy to mistake confidence (ego) for arrogance, which is the feeling that you’re better or smarter than other people. Don’t limit your sense of yourself to your own view; combining your view with those of the people around you will give you a more rounded and realistic vision of yourself.

• Self-Protection/Shame Triggers – When you begin to look within and examine your needs, motivations, and strengths, you may see things that you don’t like. This can interfere with your sense of work fit, and it can prompt a cascade of negative feelings if you’re driven to prove your competence or defend yourself. Listen to the voice in your head that tells you about you. Manage negative thoughts by showering yourself with self-compassion. As Kristen Neff (2015) says, “This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is part of life. May I be kind to myself in this moment. May I give myself the compassion I need.”

• Perceptions of Others – We’ve heard story after story of people who ignore their own needs and preferences because of the pressure they feel from those around them. Resist feeling that you’re obligated to, or should, define success by what others think. By carefully understanding your needs, dreams, desires, and ideal work environment, you’ll come to understand what you truly need to thrive. Examine your own assumptions and judgments first, and stay true to what you want.

• Confirmation Bias – Just because you really want a job to be a great fit for you doesn’t mean that it is. You must guard against your own confirmation bias when you’re considering work fit (Heshmat 2015). When you deeply want something to be true, you often end up believing that it is true, and thus you stop paying attention to evidence to the contrary.

• Lack of Time to Think – One of the most frequent complaints Moe hears in her consulting practice, from leaders at all levels, is that they simply don’t get enough time to think. To truly examine the complex nature of your work fit, you need some time to ask the right questions and look honestly at the situation you face. Oftentimes when people are feeling the budding realities of misfit, they try to solve the problem by getting even busier than normal rather than by slowing down to consider what’s happening. There are ways to remedy poor work fit, and they don’t all involve leaving your job.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• What do I need to do to create more time for myself to simply think about and process what’s going on?



Self-awareness is a lifelong process. Comfortably settling into a job for a lifetime is a reality no more. Thus, developing the lifelong practice of being self-aware facilitates your ability to be resilient, realistic, and responsive, modifying your work fit when it begins to feel less than ideal. If your work fit is poor, the person with the most ability to influence, modify, and change the situation is YOU. Look within, ask the hard questions, and pay attention to your feelings, thoughts, needs, and desires. Self-awareness, above all else, is the starting point to making work fit better.
