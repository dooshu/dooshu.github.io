13 Calculating the Elements and Weighing Trade-Offs

When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision.

— Paul Coelho, The Alchemist

WE EACH HAVE A DIFFERENT WORK FIT CALCULATION. In fact, we have many different calculations over the course of our lives. What you want is to know your calculation at this moment in time. But before we go any further, here’s a warning:

PERFECT WORK FIT DOES NOT EXIST

While we believe that fit really matters to you and the world, our research and experience tells us that work fit is always a series of trade-offs that are related to many factors, including the six elements of fit and your stage of life, even when you’re really, really thriving and content at work. What makes sense today simply may not make sense tomorrow, and this fact means that you’ll be calculating how you fit in your work situation many, many times in the course of your life.

Getting Started

Your work fit calculation requires reflection and analysis of each of the six elements of work fit (meaning, job, culture, relationship, lifestyle, and financial), individually as well as in total. Our research shows that people who are really happy at work, love their jobs, and feel a high degree of work fit have at least three of the core elements working for them, and none of the elements is causing regular pain.

We suggest that you start with your answers to the checklists for each element that you reviewed in earlier chapters in order to get a full picture of your current work fit. We’ve combined those checklists in Figure 13-1 to make it easier to review all your answers in one place.





Checklist 13-1. For each element of fit, check the statements that apply to you. Start with your assessments for each element that you made in earlier chapters in order to get a full picture of your current work fit. We’ve combined those checklists here to make it easier to review all your answers in one place. Total the number of checks for each element and enter that number in the space provided.

Congratulations! You now have a reasonably good assessment of how you’re feeling at the moment about your current work situation.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Which elements had the most items checked? The least?

• Does this surprise me?

• Do my scores surprise me? Why or why not?

• Have the highest-scoring elements been areas of satisfaction at my job for a long time?

• Are there at least three elements that have more than four items checked?

• How low are the lowest scores?



What your scores might indicate:

• If you have at least one area that has zero or one items checked, your work fit may be causing you serious pain.

• If you have at least three elements with more than four items checked, there’s a lot that’s working for you in your current situation. Congratulations on a solid fit!

• If you have no areas with zero or one items checked, you’re probably not experiencing pain in any element. Congratulations – you’re not suffering too much.

It’s always possible, however, that no matter what your score you may be feeling unhappy at work. This has to do with what in particular matters to you right now. (And be sure to resist comparing your feelings to what others are feeling – they may or may not have the same needs, interests, or priorities that you do.)

Understanding What Matters to You Right Now

No matter how you assessed your current situation, you need to understand what really matters to you right now to begin the process of improving your work fit. Perhaps you now have to deal with your aging parent, so a flexible schedule has become a priority. Or maybe your spouse recently took a job in another city and you’re worried about commute times. Or maybe you’ve started worrying about having enough money for retirement and are now working hard to save money, making financial fit a top priority. Take a few minutes and consider your stage of life, what you know about yourself, and your aspirations, and score each work fit element on how much it matters to you now (1 = not a very important element to you right now; 5 = a very important element to you right now). Use Table 13-1 to record your answers.



Figure 13-1. Rate the importance of each element of fit on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1=low importance and 5=high importance.



Figure 13-2. Enter your scores from Figure 13-1 in the what matters most to you column. Then enter scores on how your current job rates on the same scale from 1=low to 5=high. In the differential column subtract your current job rating from what matters most to you. Those elements of fit that matter most to you but have a large differential are those that you want to consider improving.

Now let’s put all your scores together. Look at what matters to you and what your current situation provides to identify any major disconnects. Use Table 13-2 to highlight the areas of focus you want to consider.

Let’s look at an example (see Figure 13-3).



Figure 13-3. In this example it’s fairly clear that Peter should focus first on improving his job fit (finding a new job either within his organization or with a new organization).

Peter is an ambitious, mid-career marketing executive who wants to move into a CMO role soon. He’s willing to work long hours, relocate his family, and take a salary cut for the opportunity to elevate his strategic responsibilities and prove he can handle a broader role. The job he currently has is for a company whose mission inspires him, and it afforded him the flexibility he needed while his children were young, but now he seeks a mentor and a more challenging role. It’s time for a change, but he feels that he can take his time to find the right match. Peter says, “I’m grateful for my current job, but I feel ready for a bigger challenge. I believe I can do a CMO role, and I feel highly motivated.” What Peter seeks next is greater job fit, an improved mentor relationship, and more financial incentives. It’s not urgent that he change jobs, but he’s clear about what he wants to seek next.

As you compare the elements that matter the most to you right now with the elements in your current job, what do you notice? Pay particular attention to how many items you’re well-satisfied with in your current role and how these compare to what matters the most to you right now. In our experience, people who are very satisfied with their work fit report that at least three of the six elements are working well for them, and none of them are causing them pain. If one (or more) of the elements is rated very low in your current situation and it’s something that matters a great deal to you right now, then your job is probably a poor work fit. Richard described his work fit this way: “My work life put too much stress on my personal life outside of work.” And Mary said, “I started to disengage at work because of a lack of impact and support. Too often there are personal and business relationships that affect the success of a couple people within an organization, so you wonder why you’re working so hard, putting in the hours, missing out on family life, with little to no progression or recognition.”

Our research revealed that if one element is untenable, or too few elements are going well, the acknowledgment of poor work fit can either come slowly or with a sudden flash of awareness. Either way, when the realization hits, and you find yourself accepting that something about your work situation needs to change, it’s both terrifying and liberating. As Hank said, “During the time I needed to work at a place that was a wrong fit the stress had a high toll on my health and my family life. Feeling unhappy and uncomfortable at work, I was constantly trying to change myself to fit in while also feeling hopeless that it could ever get better. It was physically and emotionally exhausting. By comparison, leaving was easy.”

It can be heartbreaking, after you’ve looked long and hard for a great job, to discover misfit. And for many people, the fear of admitting that it isn’t working keeps them stuck. Shireen said, “I was miserable because my work hours kept me away from my family, but I was scared to leave because I feared I’d be trading my seniority at that job for another equally bad job.”

Doing the math and feeling misfit is a process. For some people, the decision to leave precedes their actual move by months or even years, while others can act swiftly. Whatever process unfolds for you has to make sense in the context of your life. When you admit to poor work fit, you still have to weigh the costs of leaving versus the costs of staying in order to decide to change. And for some people, just the realization of misfit is the information they need to work within their existing company to find a better fit (see Chapter 15, “Flexing to Fit”).

Fit for Now

Whatever your work fit calculation revealed to you, keep in mind the phrase “fit for now.” Work fit involves a series of trade-offs. Are you willing to live with the fit with element A because this job offers you a better fit with element B? In our research, we heard story after story of people who stayed in poor fit situations because one or more elements were invaluable to them at the time.

Consider Maryellen, who discovered that her job was only a good fit on one element: the job itself. As a trial attorney, Maryellen knew she needed to work in actual trials. She had a terrible lifestyle fit in her job, which provided very little time for personal growth, paid poorly, and offered her no sense of purpose. In addition, she felt very little connection to her fellow employees or her boss, whom she described as a “tyrant.” Nonetheless, it was a prestigious firm, and she had a high volume of cases every day. She knew that the experience the job gave her could not be found easily elsewhere, so she stuck it out for two years until she felt that she had amassed enough solid experience as a trial attorney to move to an organization that fed her on the other fit elements.

Or consider Joe, who felt misfit on every element except financial fit. His wife was on disability because of a chronic pain condition, they had two small children, and his job paid far more than most other jobs in their town. Living close to family was critical for Joe and his wife because family members provided emotional support and care, so Joe was willing to stay at that job, for the time being, for the sake of the money.

What we heard consistently from people like Maryellen and Joe was that they clearly knew the trade-offs they were making, which went a long way toward soothing the pain and unhappiness they felt in their misfit situations. Some common trade-offs that people make include:

• Work and life balance trade-off for compensation

• Meaning and purpose trade-off for key experience

• Positive relationships trade-off for essential skill learning

• Career advancement trade-off for caregiving duties

• Culture that fits for great relationships

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Do I feel fit or misfit in my current role?

• If fit, how will I keep this situation going well?

• If misfit, do I think a change is necessary? And in what time frame do I think I need a change?

• Is the change I envision a modification within my current organization, or do I think that I’ll need to leave?

• What trade-offs am I making for this role, and how are they working for me?



As you assess your situation, remember that if your work fit is okay but not great, it may still be sufficient, or even appropriate, for you right now. Poor work fit in one element may be worth the sacrifice if great work fit in another element compensates for it.
