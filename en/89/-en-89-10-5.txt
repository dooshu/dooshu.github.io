E. PLAY, THE SCHOOL OF RULES

The practices that led to the formation of the spontaneous order have much in common with rules observed in playing a game. To attempt to trace the origin of competition in play would lead us too far astray, but we can learn much from the masterly and revealing analysis of the role of play in the evolution of culture by the historian Johan Huizinga, whose work has been insufficiently appreciated by students of human order (1949：esp. 5, 11, 24, 47, 51, 59, and 100, and see Knight, 1923/1936:46, 50, 60–66; and Hayek, 1976:71 and n. 10).

Huizinga writes that ‘in myth and ritual the great instinctive forces of civilised life have their origin：law and order, commerce and profit, craft and art, poetry, wisdom and science. All are rooted in the primaeval soil of play’ (1949:5); play ‘creates order, is order’ (1950:10). . . . ‘It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner’ (1949:15 and 51).

A game is indeed a clear instance of a process wherein obedience to common rules by elements pursuing different and even conflicting purposes results in overall order. Modern game theory has, moreover, shown that while some games lead to the gains of one side being evenly balanced by the gains of the other, other games may produce overall net gain. The growth of the extended structure of interaction was made possible by the individual’s entry into the latter sorts of game, ones leading to overall increase of productivity.
