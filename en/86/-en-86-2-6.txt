6 Relationship Fit

The most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people.

— Theodore Roosevelt

LOVING THE PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH makes it a lot easier to love what you do. We have found that when people reflect on the work situations in which they felt the most connected, satisfied, seen, and engaged, a key element is the people. Clay, a senior leader at a global nonprofit think tank, said, “It’s the people that make the hard parts of the job worth it. Despite some of my frustrations with the work here, or the stress, I come back every day eagerly because of my relationships with my colleagues. We’re like a family.”

Relationship fit is great when we like and respect the people we work with and when we receive the appropriate support and trust to do our job. Given how hard so many of us work to gather the skills, tools, and acumen to pursue a certain career, it can seem random and unpredictable to leave fulfillment at work in the hands of the random chance of finding people we can connect with easily in a job. So what exactly does it mean when we feel well connected to the people we work with?

What’s Really Going on with Relationship Fit?

We form friendships over the course of our lives based on a variety of factors including simple association, proximity, shared interests, common goals and hopes, and galvanizing events. More important, however, are the characteristics of affection, empathy, honesty, trust, and compassion in the connections we make with people over time. In particular, we tend to feel friendship with those people whom we can most be ourselves with, making mistakes without judgment. This process starts in childhood and extends to school and, ultimately, to work. Tom Rath (2006), in his bestselling book Vital Friends, found that those who say they have no real friends at work have only a 1 in 12 chance of feeling engaged in their job. Conversely, if you have a “best friend at work” you’re seven times more likely to feel engaged in your job.

We know from psychologists that love and belonging – in essence, friendship – exist as basic human needs for all of us (Maslow 1943). We require connection to others to feel whole.

It makes sense then that we carry these essential human needs for belonging and connection with us into the workplace, where most of us spend the majority of our time. Americans are working more than ever, often with two or more part-time jobs adding up to more than full time spent at work. With so much time spent at work, the connections matter.

Consider Christina’s story: “As a working mother, when I’m not at work, I’m usually trying to spend time with my family. As a result, my non-work friendships have dwindled to non-existent. My work friends are important to me because we spend so much time together, and we’re in the trenches, doing similar hard tasks every day. I don’t know what I would do without them.”

Most people form friendships at work in addition to friendships they may form outside of work (through childhood or family connections). When we start a job, it can feel wonderful just to experience shared interests and associations. Over time, however, the dimensions of relationships at work that grow to matter are more nuanced and harder to assess. These qualitative dimensions are often not evident until we’re well into a job.

In particular, one element of relationship fit that matters the most to us is the presence of trust and respect by and with our peers. The ability we have to be fully ourselves with others, imperfect and authentic, but still accepted and welcomed, matters a great deal. In trusting relationships we can make mistakes, learn, and grow without fear of judgment or recrimination. In the workplace, the presence of trust between colleagues is a key element of team cohesion. Vulnerability-based trust matters the most in terms of feeling positively connected to people at work. Vulnerability-based trust forms when someone reveals a mistake, admits to not knowing something, or takes a risk without a promise of success.

The very dynamics of a workplace can often interrupt the formation of vulnerability-based trust. For example, workplace competition in which employees are pitted against each other, and only one wins, can eradicate trust. And ego or actions focused only on personal gain greatly erode the capacity of employees to build trust with one another at work.

Is There Trust in Your Work Situation?

There are several tells that indicate that a group of people have invested in creating positive and healthy trust-based relationships at work. Take a look at these common characteristics:

• Individuals talk openly about their strengths and their weaknesses.

• People offer both support and challenge in meetings, clarifying intention and asking questions without appearing judgmental.

• People know more about each other than just their names.

• There are references to people’s lives outside the workplace (images, artwork, etc.).

• People seem to assume positive intention with one another.

• Competition is focused on winning in the market or against the competition rather than internally.

• Team leaders and people managers walk the talk.

• Talking to is balanced with listening to.

• People admit mistakes and discuss learning.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• To what degree is trust present in my work environment?

• Do I feel that it’s easy to show up as fully myself at work, or do I feel that I must leave parts of myself at home?

• Have I seen others admit mistakes freely?



When trust and respect don’t exist between colleagues, the fit almost always feels bad. Politics, power mongering, competition, and subtle discounting behaviors degrade the faith and confidence of colleagues and create hidden and/or public tensions. Consider Mike’s story of politics causing failed relationships at work. When he worked as the new COO of a turnaround manufacturing organization, Mike found himself consistently thwarted by one member of the leadership team who seemed unwilling to agree with any of Mike’s ideas. Over time, Mike learned that she was strongly connected to the past COO and friends with many members of the board. Given this political dynamic, building buy-in and trust with her was a long and hard road.

In great fit situations, the evolution of healthy work relationships is proportional to the trust and mutual respect that’s nurtured between people. We feel connected, so we feel safe, so we’re willing to be vulnerable, so we courageously speak our truth, which elevates others’ ability to trust us, and the cycle perpetuates itself. As Shelley said, “I knew I was valued and added value and my expertise was needed. I was in a friendly environment and enjoyed the people around me.”

Conflict as a Good Thing

Another key dimension of healthy relationships at work is the ability to successfully navigate conflict. In dynamic workplaces, where people are innovating, creating, achieving results, and solving problems, they will inevitably disagree, have ideological differences, and confront divergent points of view. If left unresolved, these differences can stymie, stunt, and stop the work at hand. The ability of people at work to move from conflict to resolution is a key determinant of whether people feel great relationship fit.

Most of us don’t eagerly seek conflict situations, since conflict tends to generate anxiety and stress. Nonetheless, the presence of healthy conflict at work allows us to feel good about the people with whom we work. Some essential elements present in conflict-healthy workplaces include:

• People challenge each other’s ideas in meetings without hesitation.

• Issues are left on the table until resolved instead of being swept under the rug.

• When people disagree, it’s done with respect.

• Conflicts are seen as ideological differences and learning opportunities rather than personal attacks.

• People tell the truth, even when it’s hard.

• Bosses model healthy conflict with their colleagues and with their teams.

• There are no “meetings after meetings” because people are forthright with their feelings in a real-time way.

Paul describes his experience working in government for 20 years as often frustrating because people hesitated to disagree: “In government, people are terrified of making decisions because they’ll be punished. People would rather do nothing than make a mistake, and they’re rewarded for that.” But to his delight, Paul and his current team members work hard to allow conflict and dissent between each other; in fact, they seek it, and he feels that this generates the best ideas. It took having a boss who was “not afraid to make a decision”; as a result “people tell each other what they really feel without fear of being punished for their input.” He loves his job today and, in particular, appreciates that his team can disagree and still do great things together.

In seeking great relationship fit at work, it’s wise to examine and understand your own capacity to build trust and mutual respect and to handle healthy conflict. Check out some of our tips in Chapter 12, “Knowing Yourself and What You Want.”

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• The last time there was a conflict at work, how satisfied was I with the resolution?

• Do I spend time and energy actively avoiding situations at work where there may be disagreements?

• Do I feel listened to, even when I see things differently?



The All-Important Boss Relationship

All of us experience our company most directly through one lens: our immediate supervisor. No matter what title we have, the relationship that matters the most is, hands down, with our boss. Years of research confirm that the most common reason people quit a job is that they have a poor relationship with their boss. Even as peer-to-peer interactions grow in importance at work, the primacy of the boss relationship and its importance to us shouldn’t be underestimated. In our interviews and survey, person after person commented that they left jobs, or felt stuck and unhappy, primarily because their relationship with their boss was poor. Carl said it this way, “I felt that I had an abusive boss/CEO who had the pretense of values but wasn’t authentic. I grew tired of feeling unimportant, part of a machine.” Or as Rachel said, “It was stressful to work for a manager who doesn’t value you, in a culture of people who aren’t invested in your development and contributions.”

The relationship we seek with our boss is complex. In addition to being the primary way in which we experience the company, we depend on our boss for task assignments, information sharing, political navigation, feedback, resources, and clarity. At its best, a great boss relationship fit feels like working with a healthy mentor. They care about what happens to us, listen, and share themselves with us in an open and transparent way. Michelle described a great boss this way, “In a nutshell, I would lie down in front of traffic for him. I trusted John to have my back, to tell me the truth, and to both work hard and hold the big picture for all of us. I would love to work with him again anywhere, anytime.” In contrast, a poor boss relationship fit stimulates the most unproductive behaviors possible at work. Distrust grows, feedback is withheld, mistakes are hidden, and backstabbing can prevail. At their worst, bad bosses don’t walk their talk, don’t make it their business to know their unique employees, don’t listen, and take credit for other people’s work.

Here’s what you should look for in a great boss:

• Trust (vulnerability!)

• Transparency

• Time for you

• Support

• Competence

• Interest in you as an individual

• Constructive feedback

In addition, recent research by Benjamin Artz (2016) at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh, suggests that bosses’ competence has “a significant measurable impact on a worker’s satisfaction and overall well-being.” In this study, supervisors’ competence had more to do with employee happiness than other potent factors such as level of education, tenure, earnings, industry, and occupation.

At times, it’s not the boss’s lack of competence that irks you, but a profound difference in your styles and approaches. As Robin said, “It was disappointing to realize that a job for which I had held high hopes was a poor fit. I could tell almost immediately that I wasn’t comfortable communicating with my boss; it was almost as though we weren’t speaking the same language. Although I’m usually a high achiever, I found myself just trying to avoid interacting with him.”

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• How do I (really) feel about my boss?

• Can I talk openly about most things?

• How do I interact with my boss?

• How does my boss give me feedback?



Remember that your relationship with your boss is a unique partnership. Kathy was caught off guard when Paul was brought in as her new direct boss. He was newly promoted to senior vice president, a position that hadn’t existed before, and Kathy’s former boss, a vice president who could have been developed for that role, took another job elsewhere. Their first meeting was off-putting. Kathy described the situation as “socially awkward, rushed, and impersonal” when she first met Paul as he was unpacking things in his office. Kathy was surprised that he didn’t ask about her role or tenure with the company, but instead spent their whole 15-minute meeting telling her about his last job. She left the room longing for her previous boss and unsettled that she felt no positive connection with her new boss. But instead of overreacting, Kathy made it her business to learn more about Paul and to interact with him in as many ways as she could. She frequently invited him to coffee, checked in with him after meetings, and listened carefully when he assigned tasks. This took extra effort, and Paul’s lack of curiosity about her concerned her, but she learned that his strategic direction was aligned with hers, and he seemed fair. Within a few months her attentiveness paid off. As Paul settled into his new job, he revealed that he had been very nervous since he really needed this job, and he felt a lot of internal pressure to perform well. He admitted that he hadn’t been a good listener and asked her to let him know if he misstepped again because he was overly self-focused. His honesty and vulnerability impressed her, and she chose to share some of the concerns she had had about him at the beginning. With burgeoning trust their relationship became solid, open, and productive within six months.

Often there are things you can do to improve a poor boss relationship fit (short of changing bosses!). We suggest that you spend some time understanding your natural relationship strengths by reviewing Chapter 12, “Knowing Yourself and What You Want.” In addition, explore ways that you can flex to fit a poor relationship with a boss in Chapter 15, “Flexing to Fit Where You Are.” Self-awareness is the first step to a great boss relationship – knowing the kind of person you connect well with, and can be inspired by, will help you to determine where and how you can adapt. Then pay attention to how your boss operates, their style of communication, their work habits, and their skill at managing, which will help you to accurately assess the reasons that your boss is either a good fit or is bringing you down at work.

When to Go for Help

In some cases, relationships at work become seriously broken, damaging, or even toxic. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel scared or uncomfortable at work because of offensive behavior, intimidation, threats, or abuse by a coworker or superior, inform your HR representative. If there’s a valid case for bringing charges of harassment, bullying, or workplace intimidation, it’s critical that the behavior has been reported first. Poor work fit in the realm of relationship fit is very different from being harassed, and the two should be treated differently. If the situation isn’t hostile, but is unproductive, a direct conversation with your boss can often ease the tension. If needed, HR or another manager can participate in support of a productive conversation.

ASK YOURSELF . . .

• Do I feel that I’m being singled out or treated differently than others at work?

• Do I frequently feel threatened or offended?

• Who can I go to with my concerns?



Assess Your Relationship Fit

When we feel trust, respect, and rapport with the people we work with, we feel good about our motivation, engagement, and outlook. Writer, executive, and leader Margaret Heffernan (2015a) says, “Social connectedness plays a role in making individuals and companies more resilient, better able to do conflict well. Investing in the connections among team members both increases productivity and reduces risk.”

Using Checklist 6-1 is a great start to looking at how the relationships in your current role are working for you. When you’re working well with others, the work is easier.

Who we work with is as important as what work we do, if not more so. Our many years of consulting to and working within organizations on issues of culture, leadership, teams, and strategy has shown us that the hard stuff is the soft stuff. What brings organizations to their knees is often not a failed strategy or a bad product but a breakdown, miscommunication, or conflict between people at work.



Checklist 6-1. Check all of the statements above that apply to you. Use the checklist as a reference as you progress in finding relationship fit. You’ll return to your answers in a final assessment of your work fit in Chapter 13.

For example, chronic mistrust between sales and production may result in poor communication, low quality, and unhappy customers who buy less. Or an organization where employees are afraid to speak out about issues may pass defects along to the next stage, hiding mistakes. For people to bring out their best ideas and innovations, they need an environment of trust, respect, kindness, and empathy that enables courage and risk. In your quest for great work fit, spend time examining the relationships you’re likely to form with your peers and your boss. It will make all the difference.
