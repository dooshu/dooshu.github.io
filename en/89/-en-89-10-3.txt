C. TIME AND THE EMERGENCE AND REPLICATION OF STRUCTURES

The fact that certain structures can form and multiply because other similar structures that already exist can transmit their properties to others (subject to occasional variations), and that abstract orders can thus undergo a process of evolution in the course of which they pass from one material embodiment into others that will arise only because the pattern already exists, has given our world a new dimension：time’s arrow (Blum, 1951). In the course of time new features arise which did not exist before：self-perpetuating and evolving structures which, though represented at any one moment only by particular material embodiments, become distinct entities that in various manifestations persist through time.

The possibility of forming structures by a process of replication gives those elements that have the capacity for doing so better chances of multiplying. Those elements will be preferably selected for multiplication that are capable of forming into more complex structures, and the increase of their members will lead to the formation of still more such structures. Such a model, once it has appeared, becomes as definite a constituent of the order of the world as any material object. In the structures of interaction, the patterns of activities of groups are determined by practices transmitted by individuals of one generation to those of the next; and these orders preserve their general character only by constant change (adaptation).
