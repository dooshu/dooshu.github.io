47：Open-Loop Warning：2018




With the Prime Minister of Thailand inspecting the mini-sub; preparing to enter the cave with the trapped boys





Pedo guy


While Kimbal Musk was on his honeymoon in early July 2018, he got an email from Antonio Gracias, Elon’s longtime friend and board member. “Sorry, dude, I know you want to be with your wife, but you have to come back right away,” Gracias wrote. “Elon is having a meltdown.”

The success of his production push should have made Musk happy. Tesla had hit its goal of producing five thousand Model 3 cars per week and was heading to a profitable quarter. SpaceX had completed fifty-six successful launches, with only one flight failure, and was now regularly landing its boosters so they could be reused. It was sending more payload into orbit than any other company or country, including China and the U.S. If Musk had been the type of person who could pause and savor success, he would have noticed that he had just brought the world into the era of electric vehicles, commercial space flight, and reusable rockets. Each was a big deal.

But for Musk, good times are unsettling. He began lashing out about what should have been small matters, such as an employee at the Nevada battery factory leaking about how much scrap material was being discarded. It was the beginning of a psychological tailspin, which lasted from July through October 2018, in which Musk was buffeted by his impetuous impulses and craving for storms. “It was another example of him being a drama magnet,” Kimbal says.

The new dramas began just after Tesla hit its five-thousand-cars-per-week milestone. Musk was scrolling through Twitter and stumbled across a message from an unknown user with very few followers saying, “Hi sir, if possible can you assist in any way to get the twelve Thailand boys and their coach out of the cave?” He was referring to a dozen Thai soccer players who had been trapped by a flood while exploring a cave.

“I suspect that the Thai govt has this under control, but I’m happy to help if there is a way to do so,” Musk tweeted.

Then his action-hero impulse kicked in. Working with engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company, he began building a pod-like mini-submarine that, he thought, could be sent into the flooded cave to rescue the boys. Sam Teller got a friend to let them use a school swimming pool for testing that weekend, and Musk began tweeting pictures of the device.

The saga became a global news story, some criticizing Musk for grandstanding. Early on Sunday morning, July 8, he checked with a leader of the rescue team in Thailand to make sure that what he was building might be useful. “I have one of the world’s best engineering teams who usually design spaceships and spacesuits working on this thing 24 hours a day,” he emailed. “If it isn’t needed or won’t help, that would be great to know.” The rescue team leader replied, “It is absolutely worth continuing.”

Later that day, Musk and seven engineers crammed into his jet along with the mini-sub and piles of equipment. They arrived in northern Thailand at 11:30 p.m. and were greeted by the prime minister, who donned a SpaceX hat and took them through the forest to the cave. Shortly after 2 a.m., Musk and his security guards and engineers, wearing headlamps, waded through waist-deep water into the dark cave.

Once the mini-sub had been delivered to the cave site, Musk flew to Shanghai, where he was signing a deal to open another Tesla Gigafactory. By that time a rescue operation using scuba divers was underway, and Musk’s sub was not needed. The boys and their coach were safe. There the story would have ended, except that a sixty-three-year-old English cave explorer named Vernon Unsworth, who had advised Thai rescuers on the scene, gave an interview to CNN dissing Musk’s efforts as “just a PR stunt” that “had absolutely no chance of working.” Unsworth suggested, with a giggle, that “he can stick his submarine where it hurts.”

Trolls and detractors fling insults at Musk every hour, and occasionally one sends him into orbit. He responded with a barrage of tweets attacking Unsworth, concluding one of them with “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.” When another user asked Musk if he was calling Unsworth a pedophile, he responded, “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.”

Tesla stock fell 3.5 percent.

Musk had no evidence for his allegations. Teller, Gracias, and Tesla’s general counsel scrambled to convince him to retract his statement, apologize, and stay off Twitter for a while. After Teller sent him an email with a proposed apology statement, Musk fired back, “I’m not happy about the suggested approach…. We need to stop panicking.” But a few hours later, Teller and others convinced him to tweet a retraction. “My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader…. Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth.”

Once again, if Musk had then been content to leave bad enough alone, things may have ended there. But in August he responded to a Twitter user who chided him over calling Unsworth a pedo by saying, “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services.” Even one of his biggest fans on Twitter, Johnna Crider, advised him, “Yo Elon, don’t feed into the drama bro thats what they want.”

By that point Unsworth had hired a lawyer, Lin Wood (who would later become infamous as a conspiracy theorist trying to overturn the 2020 election). He sent a letter warning that he was filing a lawsuit on behalf of Unsworth for defamation. When Ryan Mac of BuzzFeed asked Musk for a comment, Musk prefaced his email response by saying it was “off the record.” But BuzzFeed had never agreed to that stipulation and so printed the barrage that followed. “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,” Musk began. “He’s an old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time. There’s only one reason people go to Pattaya Beach. It isn’t where you’d go for caves, but it is where you’d go for something else. Chiang Rai is renowned for child sex-trafficking.” The statement about Unsworth’s wife was untrue, and Musk’s allegation did not help bolster his claim that the phrase “pedo guy” was simply a random insult rather than a specific accusation.I

Tesla’s major investors expressed concern. “He was kind of losing it,” says Joe Fath of T. Rowe Price, who telephoned after the pedo tweets. “This stuff has got to stop,” he told Musk, comparing his behavior to that of Lindsay Lohan, an actress who around that time was spinning out of control. “You’re doing major damage to the brand.” Their talk lasted for forty-five minutes, and Musk seemed to listen. But his destructive behavior continued.

Kimbal believed that Musk’s turmoil was partly triggered by his continuing anguish, after almost a year, over his breakup with Amber Heard. “I definitely think that 2018 tailspin was not just Tesla related,” Kimbal says. “It was a result of him just being in awful grief around Amber.”

Musk’s friends began referring to his crises as his going “open-loop.” The term is used for an object, such as a bullet as opposed to a guided missile, that has no feedback mechanism to provide it with guidance. “Whenever our friends become open-loop, meaning that they don’t have iterative feedback and don’t seem to care about the outcomes, we take it upon ourselves to let each other know,” Kimbal says. So after the pedo-tweet situation escalated, Kimbal said to his brother, “Okay, open-loop warning.” It was a phrase he would use four years later when Musk was dealing with his purchase of Twitter.





Take private


At the end of July, Musk met in the Jupiter conference room of the Fremont factory with leaders of Saudi Arabia’s government investment fund, who told him that they had quietly accumulated almost 5 percent of Tesla’s shares. As they had in previous meetings, Musk and the fund’s leader, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, discussed the possibility of taking Tesla private. The notion appealed to Musk. He hated having the value of the company determined by speculators and short-sellers, and he chafed at the regulations that came with being traded on a stock exchange. Al-Rumayyan left the matter in Musk’s hands, saying that he would “like to listen more” and would support a “reasonable” plan to take the company private.

Two days later, Tesla stock shot up 16 percent when it announced good second-quarter results, which included hitting the five-thousand-car-per-week output. Musk worried that if the stock kept rising, it would become too expensive to take the company private. So that night he sent his board of directors a memo: he wanted to take the company private as soon as possible, and he offered to do it at $420 a share. His original calculation set the price at $419, but he liked the number 420 because it was slang for smoking marijuana. “It seemed like better karma at four-twenty than at four-nineteen,” he says. “But I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ ” He later admitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission that choosing a price as a dope joke was not a wise move.

The board did not make any public announcement as it considered Musk’s suggestion. But on the morning of August 7, as he was riding to the private air terminal in Los Angeles, he unleashed a fateful tweet. “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.”

The stock shot up 7 percent before stock exchange officials temporarily halted trading. One rule for public companies is that executives must warn the stock exchange ten minutes before any announcement that might cause market volatility. Musk did not pay attention to rules. The SEC promptly opened an investigation.

The board and top management at Tesla were caught off guard. When the company’s head of investor relations saw Musk’s tweet, he texted Teller, asking, “Was this text legit?” Gracias called Musk to officially express the board’s concern and ask him to stop tweeting until the matter had been discussed.

Musk was unfazed by the flurry his tweet caused. He flew to the Nevada Gigafactory, where he joked with managers about how “420” was a marijuana reference, and worked for the rest of the day on the battery assembly line. In the evening, he flew to the Fremont factory, where he held meetings late into the night.

By this point the Saudis were expressing discomfort that their discussions about taking Tesla private had been inflated into a “funding secured” tweet. Al-Rumayyan, the head of the fund, told Bloomberg News that they were “in talks” with Musk. When Musk saw the article, he texted Al-Rumayyan, “This is an extremely weak statement and does not reflect the conversation we had. You said you were definitely interested in taking Tesla private and had wanted to do so since 2016. You are throwing me under the bus.” He added that if Al-Rumayyan did not issue a stronger public statement, “We will never speak again. Never.”

“It takes two to tango,” Al-Rumayyan replied. “We haven’t received anything yet…. We cannot approve something that we don’t have sufficient information on.”

Musk threatened to cut off discussions with the Saudis. “I’m sorry, but we cannot work together,” he told Al-Rumayyan.

Facing push back from institutional investors, on August 23 Musk rescinded his proposal to take the company private. “Given the feedback I’ve received, it’s apparent that most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company,” he said in a statement.

The blowback was brutal. “This is classic, extreme bipolar behavior risk-taking,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on air. “I’m talking about behavior that is obviously being examined by many psychiatrists who are saying classic risk-taking, this is not what a CEO should be doing.” In the New York Times, columnist James Stewart wrote that the “take private” tweet “was so impulsive, potentially inaccurate, poorly worded and thought out, and with such potentially dire consequences for himself, Tesla and its shareholders, that the board now must ask a sensitive but vital question: What was Mr. Musk’s state of mind when he wrote it?”

In order to avoid a federal lawsuit for misleading investors, Musk’s lawyers worked on a deal with the SEC to settle the charges. He would remain CEO of Tesla, step down as chairman, pay a $40 million fine, and put two independent directors on his board. Another proviso destined to become an irritant: Musk would not be allowed to make public comments or tweets about any material information without getting clearance from a company monitor. Gracias, and Tesla’s CFO Deepak Ahuja pushed hard for him to accept these terms and put the controversy—and perhaps his months of meltdown—behind him. But Musk surprised them by abruptly rejecting the proposed deal. On the night of September 26, the SEC filed a lawsuit seeking to ban him for life from running Tesla or any other public company.

Sitting at Tesla’s Fremont headquarters the next day, Musk clutched a bottle of water and stared at a large monitor tuned to CNBC. “SEC charges Tesla Founder & CEO Elon Musk with Fraud,” the chyron read. A big chart came on the screen, announcing, “Tesla stock tumbles.” It was down 17 percent. All that day, Musk’s lawyers, along with Antonio and Kimbal and Deepak, pushed him to change his mind and make a settlement. Reluctantly, he agreed to take the pragmatic course and accepted the SEC deal. The stock went back up.

Musk believed that he had done nothing wrong. He was forced to make a deal, he says, because otherwise Tesla would have gone bankrupt. “So that’s like having a gun to your child’s head. I was forced to concede to the SEC unlawfully. Those bastards.” He began joking about what SEC stood for, suggesting that the middle word was “Elon’s.”

He was partially vindicated in 2023 when he won a case against a group of shareholders who claimed they lost money based on his tweet. A jury unanimously decided that he was not liable for their losses. His hot-shot lawyer Alex Spiro argued to the jury, “Elon Musk is just an impulsive kid with a terrible Twitter habit.” It was an effective defense strategy that had the added virtue of being true.


I. The defamation suit, which included the BuzzFeed emails, went to trial in Los Angeles in 2019. Musk in his testimony apologized and said he did not believe the cave explorer was a pedophile. The jury found Musk not liable.
