APPENDIX 1



Analyze Your Employability Skills

THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE provides helpful prompts for identifying your current skills and areas where you would like more development. The eight skills listed are frequently sought by employers and aren’t exclusively related to any single career. Remember that this is an initial self-assessment exercise to help you to determine which skills are of importance to you in planning your future. Few people are likely to have developed the majority of these skills to a high level. Don’t feel that a low rating in any skill area is an admission of failure – you may have no wish to use that skill or you may be able to improve upon it with a little practice.

Is It Time to Leave? Assessment





SCORING


If you checked 1–3 statements: You are probably more satisfied than not on a given day. See what you can do to address any issues you may be experiencing.

If you checked 4–8 statements: Consider talking to your boss, a colleague you trust, or HR to see if there’s anything you can do to address the areas that you’re unhappy with.

If you checked 8–13 statements: You’re pretty unhappy with your job. Consider whether or not the areas that you’re unhappy with can be enhanced. This may not happen fast enough or meet your standards. Perhaps consider looking for other opportunities while you’re assessing whether or not change can happen.

If you checked 14 or more statements: You should probably consider leaving. Indeed, there may be room for some change, but in your case, there would need to be a lot of change and fast! Of course, you may want to look for another opportunity while you’re still employed, since it’s often easier to find a new job while you still have one.
