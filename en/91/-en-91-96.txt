Acknowledgments


Elon Musk allowed me to shadow him for two years, invited me to sit in on his meetings, indulged scores of interviews and late-night conversations, provided emails and texts, and encouraged his friends, colleagues, family members, adversaries, and ex-wives to talk to me. He did not ask to, nor did he, read this book before it was published, and he exercised no control over it.

I am grateful to all of the people listed in the sources who gave me interviews. I would like to single out a few who provided special help, photographs, and guidance: Maye Musk, Errol Musk, Kimbal Musk, Justine Musk, Claire Boucher (Grimes), Talulah Riley, Shivon Zilis, Sam Teller, Omead Afshar, James Musk, Andrew Musk, Ross Nordeen, Dhaval Shroff, Bill Riley, Mark Juncosa, Kiko Dontchev, Jehn Balajadia, Lars Moravy, Franz von Holzhausen, Jared Birchall, and Antonio Gracias.

Crary Pullen was the intrepid photo editor, as she was on many of my previous books. All of them were published by Simon & Schuster, which will forever have my loyalty because of its values and the great team it has, in this case: Priscilla Painton, Jonathan Karp, Hana Park, Stephen Bedford, Julia Prosser, Marie Florio, Jackie Seow, Lisa Rivlin, Kris Doyle, Jonathan Evans, Amanda Mulholland, Irene Kheradi, Paul Dippolito, Beth Maglione, and the ever-present spirit of the late Alice Mayhew. Judith Hoover came out of retirement at my request to be the copyeditor again. I also want to thank my agent, Amanda Urban, along with her international colleagues Helen Manders and Peppa Mignone, and my assistant at Tulane, Lindsey Billips.

And, as always, Cathy and Betsy.
